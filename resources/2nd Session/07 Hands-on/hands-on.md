# Hands-on Activity

## Learning Objectives

- use the QA checklists
- measure FAIRness of learning objects

## Introduction

It is time to tune your practical QA skills.

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to check the level of quality of two existing learning materials. In other words, you need to try use the provided QA checklists to see what pieces might be missing in the already developed learning materials, are they minimum FAIR and what can be done to improve their FAIRness.

As we are not sure that all of you have sufficient experience with GitHub and MD, the template we prepared for you is on Google drive and you can edit it online in your browser. 


## Step-by-Step Guide

0. The learning materials which you will analyse in this session are
    - [CLARIN Tools and Resources for Lexicographic Work](https://campus.dariah.eu/resource/posts/clarin-tools-and-resources-for-lexicographic-work) by Francesca Frontini, Andrea Bellandi, Valeria Quochi, Monica Monachini, Karlheinz Mörth, Susanne Zhanial, Matej Ďurčo and Anna Woldrich (2022). CLARIN Tools and Resources for Lexicographic Work. Version 1.0.0. DARIAH-Campus. 
    - [Applied Language Technology](https://www.clarin.eu/content/applied-language-technology) by Tuomo Hiippala; Faculty of Arts, University of Helsinki, Finland
1. Go to the [CLARIN Training Session 2 Hands-on folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pqa_BksPu4oWtQficeGWwj2oHuuk4fRj?usp=sharing) on Google drive
2. You will find a folder with your name on it, this is your playground
3. Inside there are two google sheets documents that you can use to keep track of your checklists progress
    - each document has three sheets that refer to the three QA frameworks that we discussed
4. Your task is to answer the questions in the frameworks by 
    - choosing the possible answers from the dropdown lists
    - reviewing the final score obtained       
5. 5 mins before the end of the hands-on you will be asked to answer a few questions about your experience

Have fun and remember you can always ask for help!

## Summary

We hope that by engaging in this task, you have not only deepen your understanding of the different quality and FAIRness aspects of learning materials but also gained practical experience in performing QA. This activity was envisioned as an opportunity to bring theory into practice. We encourage you to discuss, collaborate, and make the most of the tools provided as you work through your daily QA challenges. 

Good luck in your publication and verification efforts! 

And remember that the FAIR-by-Design Methodology team is here to support you with whatever you might need on your FAIR journey!
