# Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework

## Learning Objectives

- discuss criteria for issuing digital credentials
- identify options for digital credentials


## Introduction

The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework is designed to support the professional development and recognition of skills within the Open Science ecosystem. As Open Science becomes increasingly integral to research and data management across Europe, there is a growing need for a consistent and reliable way to certify the skills and competencies of professionals involved in this field. The framework addresses this need by providing a standardized approach to the use of digital credentials.

Key Aspects of the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework:

1. Digital Credentials:
    - The framework leverages digital credentials, such as badges and certificates, to provide tangible, verifiable proof of skills. These credentials are awarded based on specific achievements, such as completing training programs, passing assessments, or demonstrating particular competencies.
	- Digital credentials are designed to be easily shareable, allowing professionals to include them in their CVs, LinkedIn profiles, or other online portfolios. This enhances the visibility and recognition of their skills across the European research community and beyond.
2. Supporting Open Science Professionals:
	- The framework is tailored to meet the needs of various stakeholders in the Open Science ecosystem, including researchers, data stewards, librarians, and other research support staff.
	- It recognizes both formal and informal learning, offering flexibility in how skills are acquired and validated. This is particularly important in a rapidly evolving field like Open Science, where new tools, methods, and practices are constantly emerging.
3. For Instructors and Learners:
	- Instructors: The framework provides instructors with a way to certify the competencies they impart to their learners, helping to establish their credibility and expertise in Open Science.
	- Learners: For learners, the framework offers a clear pathway to gaining and demonstrating the skills necessary for working effectively in Open Science. The credentials serve as proof of their proficiency, whether they are early-career researchers or experienced professionals expanding their skill set.
4. Employer Recognition Across Europe:
	- One of the core goals of the framework is to ensure that these digital credentials are recognized by employers across Europe. By establishing a common standard, the framework makes it easier for employers to assess and validate the skills of potential hires, regardless of their location or the specific training programs they have completed.
	- This cross-border recognition is crucial for fostering mobility and collaboration within the European Research Area (ERA), enabling professionals to move between countries and institutions while maintaining the value of their credentials.
5. Integration with Existing Initiatives:
	- The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework is designed to align with other European initiatives, such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) framework, and the European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDCL) system. This integration helps ensure that the credentials are interoperable and widely accepted.
6. Promoting Lifelong Learning:
	- The framework encourages lifelong learning by recognizing continuous professional development. Professionals can earn credentials as they acquire new skills over time, helping them stay current with the latest developments in Open Science and related fields.
7. Contributing to a Sustainable Open Science Ecosystem:
	- By promoting the recognition of skills and competencies, the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework contributes to the sustainability of the Open Science ecosystem. It supports the development of a skilled workforce that can drive the adoption and implementation of Open Science practices across Europe.




## Criteria for issuing digital credentials

Providing digital credentials, such as badges or certificates, can recognize both attendance at training and the successful completion of assessments. However, each approach has its own pros and cons.

### Digital Credentials for Attendance Only

1. Pros:
	- **Encourages Participation**: Offering credentials for attendance can motivate more individuals to participate in training sessions, as they receive recognition simply for being present.
	- **Inclusivity**: It allows all participants, regardless of their performance in assessments, to receive a credential, promoting inclusivity and reducing the pressure of assessment.
	- **Easy to Administer**: These credentials are straightforward to issue, as they do not require the evaluation of participant performance, reducing administrative overhead.
	- **Building a Learning Culture**: Recognizing attendance can contribute to a culture of continuous learning, encouraging individuals to engage in more training opportunities.
2. Cons:
	- **Limited Value**: Credentials for attendance may carry less weight since they do not necessarily indicate that the recipient has gained or demonstrated any specific skills or knowledge.
	- **Potentially Misleading**: These credentials could be misleading if interpreted as a sign of competency when they only signify participation.
	- **Lack of Differentiation**: There is no distinction between those who merely attend and those who actively engage and master the material, potentially diminishing the credentialâ€™s perceived value.

### Digital Credentials for Successful Completion of Assessment

1. Pros:
	- **Demonstrates Competency**: These credentials indicate that the recipient has not only attended the training but also successfully demonstrated understanding and application of the material, making them more meaningful and valuable.
	- **Higher Recognition**: Credentials based on assessment are often more respected by employers and peers, as they provide evidence of skills and knowledge.
	- **Motivates Learning**: Knowing that they must pass an assessment to receive a credential can motivate participants to engage more deeply with the training content.
	- **Differentiates Skill Levels**: This approach differentiates between those who have mastered the material and those who have not, which can be important in professional or academic settings.
2. Cons:
	- **Excludes Some Participants**: Those who struggle with assessments may not receive a credential, which could discourage participation and be seen as less inclusive.
	- **Increased Pressure**: Participants may feel more stressed or anxious about assessments, which could negatively impact their learning experience.
	- **More Complex Administration**: Administering assessments and issuing credentials based on performance requires more resources, including time, effort, and sometimes technology, to ensure fair and accurate evaluation.
	- **Risk of Credential Inflation**: If not carefully designed, assessments could lead to credential inflation, where the credential becomes less valuable due to inconsistent or low standards.


The choice between awarding digital credentials for attendance versus successful completion of assessments depends on the goals of the training program and the value you want to convey through the credentials. If the aim is to encourage broad participation and foster a learning culture, attendance-based credentials might be more suitable. However, if the goal is to ensure that participants acquire and demonstrate specific skills or knowledge, credentials tied to assessment performance are more appropriate.

## Digital Credentials

### Open Digital Badges

### European Digital Credentials

## Summary

The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework aims to standardize the use of digital credentials to provide Open Science professionals, both instructors and learners, with verifiable proof of their skills. This framework also enables employers across Europe to recognize and validate these competencies, ensuring consistent standards and fostering professional development in the field of Open Science.
