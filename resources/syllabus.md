# Introducing the FAIR-by-Design Methodology to the CLARIN community 

{!RELEASE_NOTES.md!}

## Workshop

## Date/Time: 
- Session 1: Fri, 20 Sep 2024 14:00 - 17:00 CEST
- Session 2: Thu, 26 Sep 2024, 14:00 - 17:00 CEST

## Location: 
Online

## Description

When developing learning materials, it is essential to ensure they are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) from both the learners' and trainers' perspectives. Therefore, integrating FAIR principles into the development of learning materials is a crucial element. This training introduces the FAIR-by-Design Methodology, which provides a systematic approach that embeds the FAIR principles into the backward instructional design process.

During the training session, the participants will:

- Gain an in-depth understanding of the FAIR-by-Design workflow where each stage highlights different aspects of the learning materials design process.
- Learn practical techniques for implementing the methodology to produce high-quality FAIR learning materials.
- Engage in discussions to explore how these principles can be applied in specific real-world scenarios.

This event is organised by CLARIN ERIC, CLARIN-IT and H2IOSC in conjunction with the Skills4EOSC project.


## Target audience

- CLARIN Trainers' Network, Ambassadors and members of the CLARIN thematic committees involved in the development of training and learning resources
- CLARIN-IT members involved in training activities in the H2IOSC project
- Anyone interested in the topic is welcome to join the session and learn
