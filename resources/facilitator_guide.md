# Training Facilitator Guide

The purpose of this document is to include all necessary information regarding the preparation and planning of the training.

The training is organized as an online two-day webinar using a zoom room and Menti questions. 

The document is based on the recommendations by the TRIPLE project for Open Science training events organisation available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6256198). The training organisation relies on three roles: organisers, moderators and trainers, where one person can have multiple roes

>NOTE: it is always a good practice to separate the roles of trainer and moderator, providing better interactivity of the training. If the training has more trainers, then they can interchangeably take the role of moderators when not speaking.

The learning materials for the trainees are available on the Git repo and Git pages. One day before the training they are published on Zenodo.
