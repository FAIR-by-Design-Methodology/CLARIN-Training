# Hands-on Activity

## Learning Objectives

- develop a test micro learning unit based on templates

## Introduction

It is time to test drive some of the things that we have been talking about.

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to create a micro learning unit on Introduction to Open Science based on a FAIR-by-Design template. In other words, you need to try to put some meat on the bones provided by us while following the FAIR-by-Design methodology.

As we are not sure that all of you have sufficient experience with GitHub and MD, the template we prepared for you is on Google drive and you can edit it online in your browser. 


## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Go to the [CLARIN Training Session 1 Hands-on folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1__wsHxfQL_bydPGQZASovlWneoIHCVrj?usp=sharing) on Google drive
2. You will find a folder with your name on it, this is your playground
3. Inside there are several files that make up a template unit
    - content - the main learning content accessible to learners
    - plan - guide for trainers 
    - assessment - test questions
    - activity - description of an exercise 
4. Your task is to provide minimum information in each of these files
    - content
        - add min 1 learning objective using the Blooms taxonomy 
        - reuse min 1 image or video with attribution
            - example source: [The Open Science Training Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/02opensciencebasics/01openconceptsandprinciples) 
            - example source: [OS Training Video](https://zenodo.org/records/10564861)
        - add min 1 paragraph of text (with attribution if reused)
    - assessment
        - add min 1 multi choice question
    - activity
        - describe an ice breaker activity
        - you can adapt [Take a picture of your shoes](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/take-a-picture-of-your-shoes) or do something else if you wish
    - plan
        - fill out the template given that 
            - your unit will have max duration of 20 mins and will be held online
            - the unit structure follows the Hunter Model
            - there is summative assessment at the end of the unit
            - participant may receive an "OS explorer" badge if they pass assessment with score above 90%
5. 5 mins before the end of the hands-on you will be asked to answer a few questions about your experience

Have fun and remember you can always ask for help!

## Summary

We hope that by engaging in this task, you have not only deepen your understanding of the FAIR-by-Design principles but also gained practical experience in crafting educational content that embodies these guidelines. This activity was envisioned as an opportunity to bring theory into practice. We encourage you to experiment, collaborate, and make the most of the tools provided as you work through your daily challenges. 

Good luck in your instructional design efforts! 

And remember that the FAIR-by-Design Methodology team is here to support you with whatever you might need on your FAIR journey!
