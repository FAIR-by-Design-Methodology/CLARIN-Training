# Put it all into practice

This is the hands-on part of the FAIR-by-Design session 1 training, where participants should try to put into practice the methodology and guidelines discussed in the first part of the workshop.

## Activity duration - 20 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with - 1+

## Goal of activity

Get a hands-on experience with the essential steps of the FAIR-by-Design methodology to produce FAIR learning unit. 

## Materials
- all digital materials are available at https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/CLARIN-Training/latest/
- the working hand-on materials are on Google Drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1__wsHxfQL_bydPGQZASovlWneoIHCVrj?usp=sharing
- participants should have their own laptops with Internet access

## Instructions

The participants are provided with the link to the digital materials and are asked to follow the steps of the hands-on activity each working in their own folder.

The trainers support the participants by answering questions and helping them with any problems completing any of the assigned steps.

5 mins before the end the trainers remind the participants to jump to the last step and prepare for a retrospective set of questions.

All discuss the retrospective input together.


## Tips and Tricks

- it is difficult to track how people are doing while online, so for the "lazy" ones one trainer can share screen and "mock" the work of an imaginary participant
