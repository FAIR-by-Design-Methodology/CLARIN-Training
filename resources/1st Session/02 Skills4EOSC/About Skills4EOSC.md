# Introduction

Skills4EOSC ‘Skills for the European Open Science commons: creating a training ecosystem for Open and FAIR science’ is funded by the European Commission Horizon Europe programme (GA 101058527).

The project is coordinated by Consortium GARR and supported by 44 partners in 18 European countries.

The project officially started on the 1st of September 2022 and lasts until 31st of August 2025.

The main goals of Skills4EOSC are:

- to set up a pan-European network of competence centres to speed up the training of European researchers
- harmonise the training of new professional figures for scientific data management

The project aim is to develop common methodologies, activities and training resources to unify the current training landscape into a collaborative and reliable ecosystem and to provide dedicated community-specific support to leverage the potential of EOSC for open and data-intensive research.
