## Review key module from Session 1

If you did not follow the Session 1 from the training, please take a look at the FAIR-by-Design Methodology module to get acquainted with the main goals and activities related to the FAIR-by-Design methodology.

The FAIR-by-Design methodology augments the backward instructional design process with activities focused on implementing the FAIR principles by defining a workflow of developing FAIR-by-Design materials in several stages:

1. **Plan**: This stage involves setting clear objectives for the educational materials, identifying the target audience, and defining the content’s scope. It’s essential to consider the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) from the outset to ensure that the materials will meet these standards. Planning also includes determining the resources, tools, and collaborators needed for the project.
2. **Discover**: During the discovery stage, existing resources and gaps in available materials are identified. This involves researching existing content, tools, and technologies that can be reused or adapted. The goal is to avoid duplicating efforts by leveraging available resources and ensuring that the new materials fill an identified need in the community.
3. **Design**: The design stage focuses on structuring the educational materials in a way that aligns with FAIR principles. This includes organizing content to be easily searchable (Findable), ensuring it can be accessed by a wide range of users (Accessible), using standardized formats and protocols for compatibility with various systems (Interoperable), and creating modular content that can be repurposed (Reusable). Metadata and documentation play crucial roles in this stage, helping to maintain the integrity and usability of the materials.
4. **Produce** : In the production stage, the actual creation of the educational materials takes place. This involves developing the content according to the design specifications, using the selected tools and formats. Ensuring that the materials adhere to the planned structure and meet the FAIR principles is key during this phase. Collaboration and feedback from team members or stakeholders may also be integrated into the production process.
5. **Publish**: Once the materials are created, they are published on appropriate platforms that support accessibility and interoperability. This stage also includes attaching the necessary metadata, licenses, and documentation to ensure that the content is Findable and Reusable by others. Publishing on open-access platforms or repositories is encouraged to maximize the reach and impact of the materials.
6. **Verify**: After publication, the materials are assessed for their adherence to FAIR principles. This verification process may involve peer reviews, user testing, and gathering feedback from the intended audience. The goal is to ensure that the materials are effective, accessible, and meet the needs of the community. Any issues identified during this stage can be addressed before widespread dissemination.
7. **Continuous Improvement**: The final stage emphasizes the ongoing nature of maintaining and improving the educational materials. Based on feedback, new developments, and changes in technology or standards, the materials are regularly updated. This continuous improvement ensures that the resources remain relevant, effective, and aligned with the evolving needs of the Open Science community. Community involvement is crucial in this stage, as it provides valuable insights and contributions to the refinement of the materials.

By following these stages, educators and developers can create high-quality, FAIR-aligned educational materials that are not only effective in their immediate context but also valuable and usable across a wide range of platforms and disciplines.

In session 2 we are going to focus on activities related to the stages Publish, Verify and Continuous Improvement.
