# FAIR-by-Design Methodology Training for the CLARIN community

This repository hosts all of the materials used to prepare and hold the FAIR-by-Design Methodology training organised by Skills4EOSC and CLARIN.

The materials are divided into two major groups:
- session 1 - focusing on the FAIR-by-Design development of training materials starting from the prepare and design stages and moving on to produce. This session is aimed mostly for instructional designers.
- session 2 - focusing on the FAIR-by-Design publishing, verification and continuous improvement stages. This session is aimed mostly for training workflow and infrastructure managers
