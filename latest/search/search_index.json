This methodology ensures that learning materials, such as course content, training modules, and educational resources, are not only well-structured and high-quality but also meet specific criteria that make them easier to discover, use, and adapt within the Open Science ecosystem. In this way the methodology guarantees that the produced materials will be FAIR not just from the point of view of the learners, but also other designers and trainers that would like to reuse and adapt the materials for their own purposes. FAIR-by-Design Methodology Stages The FAIR-by-Design Methodology is created around the popular backward instructional design process that is used to develop high-quality learner-centric materials. We have taken the steps of the backward instruction design process and added additional considerations to ensure that the process will be aimed towards the design of FAIR learning content from both the perspective of the learners and the perspective of the instructional designers and trainers. The methodology is broken down into a number of stages that are connected in a feedback loop thus enabling continuous improvement: Prepare In the Prepare stage the instructional designers need to expand their skillset so that they can practically implement the FAIR principles . This means that in addition to the traditional instructional design skills, they should also be able to work with PIDs, repositories and catalogues, use a corresponding metadata schema, choose a license, and know how to acknowledge reused work with attribution. One of the important tasks in this stage is to familiarize with the RDA minimal metadata schema for learning resources as this is the basis for the description of the FAIR learning materials. This is when the backward learning process begins: Step 1 : What are your desired effects, i.e. learning outcomes? Step 2 : How are you going to assess the learners' achievements? Step 3 : How should you structure the material to reach them? This is the initial stage of the learning materials development process and thus it is important that in this stage the designer clearly defines the purpose of the learning materials, the target audience and the learning objectives while taking into consideration any prerequisites. Purpose When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes? Target Audience Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context? Prerequisites What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process? Scope Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course? Learning Objectives What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process? Objectives should be S pecific, M easurable, A ttainable, R elevant and T ime-bound. Use Blooms Taxonomy: Formulate the objectives as actionable verb + observable knowledge, skill, attitude, behavior or ability. Discover Once the vision of what needs to be created is clear, the next step is to discover any existing learning materials that can be reused or simply serve as inspiration. For these purposes the designer needs to search different types of repositories that might host similar learning materials including OER repositories, learning platforms, general repositories and catalogues, as well as multimedia repositories that can provide sources of audio/visual props that are essential in multi-modal learning. SSH Training Materials CLARIN Learning Hub UPSKILLS Learning Content SSH Open Marketplace DARIAH Campus OER DOAB MERLOT OASIS OER Commons OERTX CORA GALILEO FORRT EOSC_ EOSC Training catalogue on the EOSC Marketplace Most EOSC projects have their own training catalogues and/or platforms...

The next step is to sketch a conceptual map of the learning materials that will help crystalize the ideas and prepare the syllabus for the learning materials. The syllabus is then used as a high-level blueprint for the development of the learning materials. In the design stage the overall structure of the learning materials is defined identifying all modules and learning units necessary together with the information on what can be reused and what needs to be designed from scratch. Careful attention should be put on license compatibility during this work. Tip Create an intuitive logical organisation of all learning materials. Tip The goal is for other people to easily reuse a single item (plan, activity, unit, assessment, ...). Tip Use a hierarchical structure to combine learning units into larger compositions. Upon completing the structure, each learning unit needs to be designed using a modeling technique such as the Hunter's model. The design stage should also take into account the need for development of a facilitation guide that explains in details how to prepare and put the training into practice, as well as a feedback form that should be used to gather feedback after the learning process has finished Produce When the design is complete, it is time to move to the produce stage and choose the tools and file formats necessary to develop all of the content. Care must be taken that the chosen file formats are open so that reusability is supported, and it is recommended that a collaborative, versioning system is used to keep track of all contributions and changes. It is important to consider both the editable files that can be reused by trainers and the final file formats intended for learners. Collaborative environment for team work Choose an environment for producing the learning material that will enable multiple people to work on the same material at one. Two examples are workplace or GitHub (find out more here ). Replicate the folder tree in the environment and start using the provided templates to generate the content. Granular versioning for easy rollback Versioning helps you maintain control over your changes. If the collaborative environment does not provide versioning and history retention then keep a history of the files by adopting a naming convention such as combining the file name with an increasing version number. Open file formats to foster reuse For other people to reuse your materials they should be made available using open file formats (docx, pptx, pdf, md, html, etc.). If you use close file formats then you MUST clearly state the tools that have been used for development in your README file. Multimodal content to reach all audience Don't forget to include different types of multimedia to provide support for different learning modalities: read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic. Two file sets: editable + final Always work with and keep a history of your editable files. These are what matters for you and other instructors. The second set of final files should be obtained from the editable when needed (before distributing them to the learners). The final files should be kept on the learning platform only. In this way you don't need to worry about keeping the versions in sync. Don't forget to support co-creation Truly FAIR learning materials should enable co-creation with external parties. If you don't use a collaborative environment that supports this from the start (such as GitHub), then think how are you going to enable this in the future and how are you going to deal with versioning then. One of the most important aspects of the produce stage is accessibility of the developed learning materials . Accessibility standards should be followed so as to maximize the audience for the learning materials. During this stage the designers must not forget to add the human-readable and machine-readable metadata in the developed content as well as to develop the content of all facilitation documents such as the guide, activities description, lesson plans, etc. The final step in the produce stage is to perform an internal Quality Assessment that will check that all elements are present and that the content is adequate. Publish A satisfactory completion of the internal QA leads to the publication steps. Before the actual publication, very important final touches need to be done including activities such as the definition of the content of accompanying files : license, readme, citation, code of conduct and alike. Accompanying files Define the overall license, provide description, instructions on how to cite your materials, define the code of conduct for a co-creation environment, etc. Put into repository Publish the editable package in an appropriate FAIR repository. This record is primarily intended for reuse by other designers and trainers. Provide to learners Provide the final non-editable versions to the learners on a learning platform of your choice. Some additional guidelines on FAIR repositories are available at Find a FAIR repository . One of the available options is to use fairsharing.org to search for a suitable FAIR repository. fair-checker to check the FAIRness of a given repository. It is important to also consider adding a reference to the repo in a corresponding catalogue such as the SSH Open Marketplace if this is not done by automatic harvesting of the chosen repository. Verify The final steps in the methodology is to perform another QA round, this time focusing on external QA . At this stage the overall level of FAIRness of the learning materials needs to be checked and external experts should be used to provide unbiased feedback regarding the quality of the produced materials. A fresh set of eyes Have someone who has not participated in the development of the learning materials review the final work. This will guarantee a review free of cognitive bias. Don't forget to QA the Learning Management System (LMS) The reviewer should play the role of a new learner in the LMS and check everything from the learner perspective. Go through the QA checklists In Skills4EOSC T2.4 has developed a number of QA checklists that you and your external reviewer need to go through so that you can ensure high-quality learning materials (see S\u00e1nchez et al. 2023 ). This stage also focuses on setting up different mechanism for gathering feedback so that the learning materials can be further improved. In this way it fosters the co-creation process that empowers learners and other designers and trainers to actively participate in the development. Continuous Improvement The gathered internal and external feedback should be used as input for the development of a new version of the learning materials. Upon the identification of potential improvements that should be implemented, the development process circles back to the first stage aiming to publish a new improved version of the learning materials. Gather Gather feedback from all available internal & external sources. Analyse Analyse the gathered information in a structured way. Create a list of potential improvements with impact level (high, moderate, low). Improve Select items from the list that will be part of a new version. Choose items that make sense to be in the same new release. Repeat Start a new cycle of the FAIR-by-Design methodology that will implement the selected items. After the Verify stage, you will reenter continuous improvement with newly gathered information.... Summary The FAIR-by-Design methodology proposes six stages that aim to ensure that the end result will be FAIR Learning Materials that are: Findable : Learning materials are indexed in a way that makes them easily discoverable by both humans and machines. This typically involves assigning persistent identifiers, such as DOIs, and providing rich metadata that includes detailed descriptions, keywords, and other information that facilitates search and discovery. Accessible : The materials are available to users under clear conditions, often through open access platforms. This means ensuring that the resources can be accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions or licenses, without unnecessary barriers like paywalls or restrictive access conditions. Interoperable : Learning materials are designed to be compatible with various systems and tools. This involves using standardized formats, protocols, and vocabularies that enable the integration and use of the materials across different platforms, enhancing the ability to mix, match, and repurpose content. Reusable : The resources are created with reuse in mind, allowing others to easily adapt or repurpose them for different contexts. This requires clear licensing, proper documentation, and a modular design that facilitates modification and customization.

One of the important tasks in this stage is to familiarize with the RDA minimal metadata schema for learning resources as this is the basis for the description of the FAIR learning materials. This is when the backward learning process begins: Step 1 : What are your desired effects, i.e. learning outcomes? Step 2 : How are you going to assess the learners' achievements? Step 3 : How should you structure the material to reach them? This is the initial stage of the learning materials development process and thus it is important that in this stage the designer clearly defines the purpose of the learning materials, the target audience and the learning objectives while taking into consideration any prerequisites. Purpose When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes? Target Audience Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context? Prerequisites What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process? Scope Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course? Learning Objectives What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process? Objectives should be S pecific, M easurable, A ttainable, R elevant and T ime-bound.

These elements need to be standardized so that they are useful when used in practice. This is done by defining a metadata schema that describes the structure of the metadata elements. The metadata schema defines the standards for describing the metadata elements. The metadata schema for learning resources that also defines the type of each element, the allowed values, and constraints is available on the RDA website: RDA Minimal Metadata for Learning Resources Professional and Informal Education Examples Controlled Vocabularies Some of the fields in the proposed RDA metadata schema are based on fixed or suggested controlled vocabularies (CV). The use of controlled vocabularies is to help humans and machines categorize the information while helping to reduce duplication and errors. In essence, controlled vocabularies should be used for any metadata elements with predefined value(s), where in the vocabulary is presented as a list of prescribed items. Such examples are Access Cost with possible values of Y, N and Maybe Primary Language that can be a two letter code from the ISO 639-1:2002 codeset Examples of relevant control vocabularies for the CLARIN community, available at SSH Vocabulary Commons SKOSMOS instance include: SSH Training Discovery Toolkit Formats of training resources Intended audience Status of training resources SSHOC SSHOC Multilingual Data Stewardship Terminology SSHOC Multilingual Metadata CLARIN Service Description CLARIN taxonomy for Linguistic subjects CLARIN taxonomy for tools and services tasks In the Skills4EOSC project, a specific example of using controlled vocabularies are different lists of OS Skills Terms t4FS: 223 'data stewardship activity' terms CSCCE Glossary: 45 terms listed according to 5 dimensions, selecting those included in 'skills wheel' for scientific community managers ResearchComp Note that in many cases controlled vocabularies are suggested, but at this stage they are not strictly defined. Syllabus Once you have identified your learning concepts, the next step is to sequence them into an instructional sequence (agenda). This instructional sequence will become your blueprint for the organisation of the learning materials and the definition of the syllabus. In essence the blueprint takes the input from the creative concept map and organizes it into a more formal outline. Formally, we call this learning materials outline syllabus. Each syllabus should provide information regarding a number of elements (including the ones defined in the step 1 of the backward instructional design): clear, descriptive title description of the purpose or goal target audience prerequisites duration learning objectives agenda (instructional sequence) resources and materials certification information Remember that: The syllabus can present a higher level sequence outline, that can be later broken down into smaller subtopics if necessary. The topics sequence should be defined so that the concepts introduced early help with the ones encountered later. The defined agenda should not be very rigid thus preventing changing the sequence of topics or adding or deleting topics at a later stage. The syllabus is sent to the learners and should provide them with all necessary information to help them decide if they want to follow the training related to the learning materials. Syllabus Elements Within this training we recommend the development of a training syllabus that consists of two groups of information: typical syllabus information additional information related to the RDA minimal metadata schema The following is a list of all required syllabus fields : Clear descriptive Title of the training Type (Course/Workshop/Webinar) Date/Time: when it will be offered (available from date if it is self-paced) Location - where it will be available physical location URL link to resources (and virtual room if online) should lead to the learning platform Training Description - what is the main goal/purpose of this training Target audience: target audience description Expertise Level / Skill Level: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced Primary Language: English Access Cost: N Prerequisites - if any Duration - total training duration Training objectives - list of specific training objectives Keywords - Keywords or tags used to describe the training Agenda: Training Schedule - Training Structure (time, topic) Resources and Materials - list with locations of available/required resources for the training Certification Information - if any Author(s) - Comma separated List of people involved in preparing the training (Name Surname) Trainer(s) - Comma separated list of people involved in delivering the training (Name Surname ORCID logo link) Contact information - how to reach out to training organizers License PID Accessibility Mission As syllabus is one of the required documents for the FAIR-by-Design learning materials, you must ensure that your syllabus contains all elements provided in this section. Only in this way you will ensure that your learning materials contain all necessary metadata information together with the traditional syllabus information that is provided. Defining learning objectives Learning objectives should describe what new knowledge and skills will be obtained in a specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) way. The learning objectives are used to organize specific topics or individual learning activities so that the learner can most effectively achieve the overall learning outcome. To ensure standardization and wide understanding of the learning objective, it is best practice to define the learning objectives using a well-known taxonomy such as the Bloom\u2019s taxonomy . The Bloom's Taxonomy is a classification of the different objectives and skills that educators set for their students (learning outcomes). The cognitive domain categorizes the human learning process into 6 hierarchical levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. \" Bloom's Revised Taxonomy \" by Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching licensed under the terms of the CC-BY-2.0 . When defining learning objectives using the Bloom's taxonomy, correct verbs should be used for each objective based on the level the learners needs to achieve. For these purposes the example verbs provided in the image can be used. Bloom's taxonomy by Fractus Learning . (2023, July 10). In Wikipedia licensed under the terms of CC BY-SA 4.0 . This approach will significantly improve the findability of the produced resources, as well as the potential reuse of individual learning objects in different aggregations. The number of learning objectives depends on the aggregation level of the learning resource that is being developed. Summary Using metadata has crucial importance when producing learning resources that need to be findable and reusable. Skills4EOSC supports the usage of RDA Minimal Metadata for Learning Resources. In addition the usage of controlled vocabularies helps in standardizing terms for consistency. A syllabus organizes learning concepts into a structured instructional sequence, and learning objectives should be defined clearly using frameworks like Bloom's Taxonomy to ensure they are specific and measurable.

See the detailed training on how to use it step by step. Learning Unit Plan To ensure rich learning experience it is imperative to develop a learning unit plan. This document incorporates all aspects that should lead to a high quality learning experience as it defines the plan on how to use teaching methods and the learning content together with activities to achieve the defined learning objectives. Note that an effective lesson plan for online trainees may not be the same to the one for traditional workshop settings. Formally, a unit plan refers to a detailed step-by-step guide for a trainer to understand what materials to give to students and how to provide them so students would accomplish their learning goals. There may be different detail levels of the learning unit plan: Detailed: a detailed plan that includes what will be the trainer step-by-step plan and learning activities. Semi-detailed: a semi-detailed plan is less complex and offers a general game plan of what will be covered in the unit. It is recommended that you follow the Hunter's model for developing a learning unit plan: Set Learning Objectives ... what is the goal Identify Needs ... how to get there Plan ... share the agenda Hook ... why is the content important Instruct ... watch how I do it Practise ... you help me do it, I'll watch you do it Wrap-Up ... foster retention and reinforcement Evaluate ... monitor progress Reflect ... how did it go? Read more about the Hunter Model Learning Unit Plan Development In a nutshell, the required information that you need to provide in your learning plan is: Unit Name Purpose of the unit Location Duration Number of attendees Learning objectives Plan including topic, duration, key points, teaching methods, activities and resources Assessment Certification Reflection Remember that although some parts of this information may seem repetitive with the overall syllabus, the plan is much more detailed and the repetition provides the much needed context for reuse. Learning Content Once you have a plan, it is time to start developing the learning content. Remember to design the content so that it appeals learners with different modalities (verbal, audio, read/write, kinesthetic) including different multimedia. The learners notebook is the main learning content that you are aiming to introduce the learners to. The content of each learning unit notebook should include: brief introduction learning objectives target audience duration prerequisites learning tools content summary suggested reading Again, although some items may seem repetitive compared to the syllabus, bear in mind that this is done in order to improve reusability. In this way the learning unit can be reused as a stand alone package. Remember to add different types of media to the content, supporting an integrated multi-modal approach. For pure self-based learning the complete notebook should be enough to present all of the learning content in one place. Slides For trainer led environments, usually a slide deck is also necessary so that the trainer can lead the trainees across the learning content and work with them through the activities. The slide deck should follow the stages of the HUNTER model. What about instructor notes? Need to be detailed enough so that anyone can reuse the slides properly. Don't put them in the slide deck. This is what the learning content file is for. Activity description All activities that are planned to be performed with or by the learners as part of the learning unit plan should be described in enough details so that they can be executed by any trainer or facilitator no matter if they are part of the original instructional design team or not. They could be only tasked with training implementation, or they could be simply reusing the learning material. In addition, this additional documentation related to activity description can serve as a personal reminder long after the training has been completed and it allows for keeping notes on how the activity was implemented as well as any external community feedback. Based on the best practices, each activity should be described in a separate document that contains: activity name short description duration number of people it can be performed with goal materials instructions tips and tricks related sources comments This example of an activity description document related to one of the activities offered in this training can help you visualise the type of information that needs to be included for each activity. A set of well described and reusable activities can be found at the Session lab website . Another source of activities is 25 activities for making lecture-based training active . Assessment Thinking about how you can assess the learners obtained knowledge is part of step 2 of the backward instructional design process. Traditionally, there are many different types of assessments that can be performed, but the most typically used in professional training and certification is the quiz form. In general, quizzes can be used in a large variety of settings, providing opportunities for reflection, knowledge improvement with feedback or assessment. Although they can be setup as formative (after each learning unit) or summative (one exam quiz at the end), from the FAIR-by-design perspective, it is recommended that at least the questions that form the quiz are setup in a formative way, meaning each learning unit comes with a set of questions that are related to that particular learning unit. In this way, it is up to the instructor to setup the assessment: is it going to be multiple quizzes throughout or is it going to be one in the end. When designing the quiz questions one should go back to the Bloom's taxonomy introduced . This time however, you are interested in what type of quiz question can be used to assess the knowledge of a different level of the cognitive domain. This is presented in the table below. T/F MC MS LA SA FIB MAT ORD Create X Evaluate X X X X Analyze X X X Apply X X X X X Understand X X X X Remember X X X X X where T/F - True/False MC - multiple choice MS - multi-select LA - long answer SA - short answer FIB - fill in the blank MAT - Matching ORD - Ordering Assessment Strategy Once you have defined your quiz questions, the next step is to define the quiz strategy. This strategy can be defined separately for each quiz as a common strategy for all formative quizzes, or can be one strategy for the summative final exam In the first case, a separate strategy document needs to be developed for each learning unit, while for the later two options (recommended) the quiz strategy can be described in the main facilitation guide document (see next learning unit for more details). If each learning unit has its own quiz strategy then it should be provided together with the learning unit. Learning Unit Structure To summarise, a complete learning unit consists of several parts: learning unit plan learning unit content optional slide deck or similar type of instructional material activities description assessment quiz and strategy Facilitation Guide As the syllabus represents the learner's view of the learning materials, the facilitation guide is a document that represents the trainers view and aims to enable a smooth and efficient training. Thus the guide aims to help with the general activities regarding the organisation of the training, what needs to be done before, during and after the training, how to setup the training environment, prepare any props and materials, etc. A well-defined facilitation guide should include the following elements: what to do before during after the training where are all of the materials that should be used during the training digital materials location physical resources and equipment needed e.g. projector e.g. activity resources such as card decks etc. how to prepare the materials beforehand e.g. something needs to be written on flip charts how to prepare the learning environment room layout and any other specifics (e.g. name tags, sign-in sheet, etc.) in case of an online training this includes preparation of the virtual room, providing access, sending out or publishing reading materials, etc. In the case of a summative or common quiz strategy it can contain this information as well. For best visibility, the guide should also contain shortcuts to all activities planned. However, any specific details and notes should be available in the learning unit plan. Available facilitation guide kit The facilitation guide should help prepare for the actual training. If you don't want to develop your own, use something that is already available such as the TRIPLE project TRAINING TOOLKIT . Feedback At the end of the learning process you should gather feedback from the learners so that they can provide feedback on what worked well and what should be improved in the training and learning materials. For these purposes a set of feedback questions should be drafted. The feedback can be gathered by enabling the learners to answer the questions using different modalities: physically by filling out a feedback sheet digitally using a feedback form created on the learning platform or using some other survey system Available feedback form The feedback form template is ready to be used as is. All you need to do is change the name of the training. It should be shared with training participants after the training, to gather quantitative and qualitative feedback. Summary Creating an effective learning experience begins with clearly defined learning objectives, which serve as a roadmap for what students should achieve by the end of the course. To support instructors, an Instructor Kit provides all necessary resources and tools to guide the teaching process. However, at the heart of any course, structure is critical\u2014ensuring that learning flows logically and builds on prior knowledge. Central to this is the Learning Unit Plan, a detailed outline of each module, specifying content, activities, and assessments. The process of Learning Unit Plan Development involves designing units that align with the learning objectives, creating a seamless progression from one concept to the next. These units contain curated learning content, which may range from lectures and readings to videos or interactive materials. Equally important are the activity details, where learners engage with the material through discussions, exercises, or hands-on tasks that deepen their understanding. The course\u2019s assessment mechanisms, including both formative and summative strategies, help measure progress and reinforce learning. An effective assessment strategy ensures that learners are evaluated fairly and that the results align with the course\u2019s objectives. Lastly, a facilitation guide is essential for instructors, offering clear guidelines on how to manage the learning environment, deliver content, and support students. Feedback questions provide an opportunity to gather insights from learners, ensuring continuous improvement in both content and delivery.

Traditionally, there are many different types of assessments that can be performed, but the most typically used in professional training and certification is the quiz form. In general, quizzes can be used in a large variety of settings, providing opportunities for reflection, knowledge improvement with feedback or assessment. Although they can be setup as formative (after each learning unit) or summative (one exam quiz at the end), from the FAIR-by-design perspective, it is recommended that at least the questions that form the quiz are setup in a formative way, meaning each learning unit comes with a set of questions that are related to that particular learning unit. In this way, it is up to the instructor to setup the assessment: is it going to be multiple quizzes throughout or is it going to be one in the end. When designing the quiz questions one should go back to the Bloom's taxonomy introduced . This time however, you are interested in what type of quiz question can be used to assess the knowledge of a different level of the cognitive domain. This is presented in the table below.

To support instructors, an Instructor Kit provides all necessary resources and tools to guide the teaching process. However, at the heart of any course, structure is critical\u2014ensuring that learning flows logically and builds on prior knowledge. Central to this is the Learning Unit Plan, a detailed outline of each module, specifying content, activities, and assessments. The process of Learning Unit Plan Development involves designing units that align with the learning objectives, creating a seamless progression from one concept to the next. These units contain curated learning content, which may range from lectures and readings to videos or interactive materials. Equally important are the activity details, where learners engage with the material through discussions, exercises, or hands-on tasks that deepen their understanding. The course\u2019s assessment mechanisms, including both formative and summative strategies, help measure progress and reinforce learning. An effective assessment strategy ensures that learners are evaluated fairly and that the results align with the course\u2019s objectives. Lastly, a facilitation guide is essential for instructors, offering clear guidelines on how to manage the learning environment, deliver content, and support students. Feedback questions provide an opportunity to gather insights from learners, ensuring continuous improvement in both content and delivery.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"1st%20Session/05%20Facilitator%20kit/Facilitator%20kit/#suggested-reading","text":"Skills4EOSC FAIR-by-Design Methodology for Learning Materials Development Skills4EOSC FAIR-by-Design Microlearning Stage 1 Prepare Skills4EOSC FAIR-by-Design Methodology Stage 2 Design","title":"Suggested Reading"},{"location":"1st%20Session/06%20Rich%20learning%20exp/Rich%20learning%20experience/","tags":["Multimedia","Learning modality","Accessibility"],"text":"Rich learning experience Slides Download the slides here Learning objectives Upon completing this module the learner should be able to: identify different learning modalities design multimedia rich content develop accessible learning content Learning modalities Effective learning experience is crucial for application of the obtained knowledge and skills in real world context. To achieve this, not only the learning objectives, but all content, activities, assignments and assessments must be learner-centered. Learners perform best when they are engaged in authentic activities, collaborate with peers to share and deepen their understanding, and apply their existing skills to different contexts and new problems. Rich learning experiences can be supported by inquiry-based learning structures, such as projects and performance tasks thoughtfully interwoven direct instruction opportunities to practice and apply learning It is important that learners are given meaningful tasks that build on their prior knowledge together with a safe positive environment in which they can receive timely and helpful feedback. Units should be well structured so as to reduce the unnecessary cognitive load, and based on multiple modalities and tools for accessing information and expressing learning to support different types of learners. Learning modalities refer to the different ways individuals process and retain information. These modalities highlight the diverse preferences and strengths people have when it comes to learning. The most commonly recognized learning modalities include: Visual Learners who prefer visual modalities understand and remember information better when it is presented in a visual format, such as diagrams, charts, graphs, and images. They benefit from seeing concepts and ideas. Auditory Auditory learners process information most effectively when it is heard. They learn well through lectures, discussions, podcasts, and verbal instructions. Reading/Writing These learners prefer interacting with text-based information. They excel in reading and writing tasks, such as taking notes, reading books, and writing essays or reports. Kinesthetic Kinesthetic learners are hands-on learners who grasp concepts best through physical activity and movement. They benefit from experiments, role-playing, and using objects or tools. Some theories and frameworks expand on learning modalities, recognizing that people often use a combination of these modalities rather than relying on a single one. Understanding and catering to different learning modalities can enhance teaching strategies and improve learning outcomes by providing varied methods of instruction that align with learners\u2019 preferences. Adding multimedia to the learning content Incorporating multimedia into learning content is directly related to learning modalities because it allows educators to address and engage different types of learners more effectively. Multimedia aligns with various learning modalities: Visual Learners: Multimedia can include videos, infographics, animations, and diagrams that visually represent concepts. This appeals to visual learners by providing clear and engaging ways to understand and remember information. Auditory Learners: By adding audio elements such as narrations, podcasts, or sound effects, multimedia caters to auditory learners who benefit from hearing information. This can include explanations, discussions, or even background music that reinforces the learning material. Reading/Writing Learners: Multimedia can integrate text-based elements, such as subtitles, captions, or interactive reading materials, which appeal to learners who prefer to read and write. Hyperlinks to additional reading, digital flashcards, or interactive eBooks also support this modality. Kinesthetic Learners: Interactive multimedia, such as simulations, virtual labs, or drag-and-drop activities, allows kinesthetic learners to engage with the content through physical interaction. This hands-on approach helps them better grasp and retain the material. By integrating multimedia, educators can create a richer, more inclusive learning environment that accommodates different learning preferences. It also helps to reinforce concepts through multiple channels, increasing the likelihood that learners will understand and retain the material. Adding multimedia to MD content While Markdown itself is quite simple, it can be enhanced with multimedia by incorporating various elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content. Different types of multimedia can be added to Markdown content by: Images To add images, use the following syntax: ![Alt text](image-url) such as ![A beautiful sunset](https://example.com/sunset.jpg) or if it is a local file ![Alt text](./path/to/image.jpg) Images in MD One of the most important things to remember is that the \"alt text\" is alternative text for the image that is used for accessibility purposes. It will be read by a screen reader that helps learners with visual impairments. Icons add visual interest and can help convey meaning quickly. While Markdown itself doesn\u2019t support icons natively, you can use HTML or rely on Markdown extensions or themes that support icons. Example <i class=\"fas fa-info-circle\"></i> This is an informational icon. Videos While Markdown doesn\u2019t natively support embedding videos, you can use HTML to embed videos from platforms like YouTube or use a link to direct users to the video. Using HTML (embedded video): <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Using a link (linked video): [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) Videos in MD As in the examples, it is best practice to put the video on a video streaming provider and then link or embed it. This helps keep the repo lean as video files are quite big, plus it allows you to use some advanced features such as auto captioning, chapters, playlists, etc. GIFs Another option is to use embedded GIFs as short videos. In this case it is as if you are adding an image ![Funny cat](https://example.com/funny-cat.gif) Audio To include audio, you can also use HTML: <audio controls> <source src=\"audio-file-url.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> for an example Your browser does not support the audio element. Accessible multimedia Provide transcripts and captions for audio and video content to make them accessible to all users. Interactive elements For more complex interactive elements, one might use HTML or specialized tools that support enhanced Markdown (like Jupyter notebooks or MkDocs): Interactive Maps, Charts, or Widgets: You can embed these by using <iframe> or specific Markdown extensions supported by your platform. Example (Embedded Map using HTML) <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18...\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe> Slideshows If you need to add a slideshow, you might use Markdown libraries such as Reveal.js that convert Markdown into presentation slides. Slides to narrated video To turn your slides into a video with text-to-speech narration using AI empowered tools, follow these steps: Prepare Your Slides Ensure your slides are in the correct sequence and format. Export your slides as images or PDFs if your chosen video editor requires it. Create a Script for Narration Write down the text you want to be narrated for each slide. Ensure the script matches the flow and content of your slides. Generate Text-to-Speech Narration Use a free text-to-speech tool like Google Text-to-Speech, Balabolka, or Natural Reader (free versions available): Google Text-to-Speech : If you have a Google account, you can use Google Cloud\u2019s Text-to-Speech API for free (up to certain limits). Balabolka : software that allows you to convert text files to speech and save them as audio files. Natural Reader : Offers an online version that can read text aloud and download the audio. Convert your script into audio files, one for each slide or section. Combine Slides and Audio into a Video Use a free video editor like OpenShot, Shotcut, or iMovie (if on macOS): OpenShot : A free, open-source video editor that supports adding images, text, audio, and transitions. Shotcut : Another free, open-source video editor with more advanced features. iMovie : Free for macOS users, simple and intuitive for basic video editing. Import your slides and audio files into the video editor. Arrange the slides in sequence, and sync each slide with the corresponding audio. Add transitions, background music, or any other effects you desire. Export Your Video Once your video is complete, export it in your preferred format (e.g., MP4, MOV). Ensure the settings match your desired resolution and quality. Review and Finalize Watch the video to check for any syncing issues or mistakes. Make any necessary adjustments before finalizing your video. Bonus use the slides and narration content to build MD content around the generated video. Linking to Files For documents, PDFs, or other files: [Download the PDF](https://example.com/document.pdf) Markdown Extensions Some Markdown processors support extended syntax for including multimedia, such as MathJax for equations or Mermaid for diagrams. See the example in the previous module where the structure is presented using Mermaid. Admonitions are special call-out boxes that highlight important information or warnings. They help users quickly identify key points or notes. Use Admonitions to Highlight Key Information. Code blocks can also be used to provide source code examples to learners. Integrating Jupyter Notebooks with MkDocs can provide a powerful way to combine interactive code, data analysis, and documentation. This is particularly useful for projects that involve both technical explanations and live code examples. To mix MD with Jupyter Notebooks you can: Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown or HTML Jupyter Notebooks can be converted to Markdown or HTML, which can then be included in your MkDocs site. Use nbviewer or GitHub Gists for Live Notebooks services like nbviewer or GitHub Gists to embed live notebooks, such as [View Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/username/repository/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) Use jupyter-book for a Comprehensive Solution consider using jupyter-book, which is designed to work with Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown to create interactive books. also, the jupyter-mkdocs plugin enables you to run Jupyter Notebooks directly within MkDocs. Final Tips Maintain a Consistent Style : Use consistent image sizes, captions, and positioning throughout your content. Test Compatibility : Ensure that the multimedia elements work in the Markdown processor or platform you\u2019re using. Responsive Design : Ensure that your multimedia content is responsive, especially when using HTML, so that it looks good on different screen sizes. Provide Download Links for Media : Some users might prefer or need to download media files instead of viewing them directly in the browser. Documentation : Ensure that you provide clear documentation and context for users interacting with the Jupyter notebooks. DON'T Don\u2019t Overload Pages with Too Much Multimedia Why: Excessive multimedia can overwhelm users, slow down page loading, and distract from the core content. Tip: Use multimedia sparingly and only when it adds value to the content. Don\u2019t Use Low-Quality Media Why: Poor-quality images, videos, or audio can reduce the credibility and professionalism of your content. Tip: Always use high-resolution images and clear audio/video files. Don\u2019t Forget to Test Media Content Why: Media might not display or function as expected across different browsers or devices. Tip: Always test embedded media on multiple platforms before publishing. Don\u2019t Ignore Accessibility Why: Multimedia content should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Tip: Use alt text, provide transcripts for videos, and ensure that interactive elements are keyboard-navigable. Don\u2019t Link to Unreliable External Sources Why: Linking to external media that may be removed or blocked can result in broken links or missing content. Tip: Host essential media content yourself or ensure that external links are stable. Don\u2019t Use Auto-Playing Media Why: Auto-playing videos or audio can be intrusive and may disrupt the user\u2019s experience. Tip: Always allow users to control when media plays. Don\u2019t Neglect to Credit Sources Why: Failing to attribute media to its original creator can lead to copyright issues and diminish the trustworthiness of your content. Tip: Always include proper citations or credits when using third-party media. Don\u2019t Rely Solely on Multimedia Why: Some users may prefer or require text-based content, so always include a textual explanation or description of your multimedia. Tip: Pair videos with summaries, and images with descriptive captions. This approach helps create rich, multimedia-enhanced learning content that can cater to different learning modalities, making your materials more engaging and effective. Accessibility All developed learning content should be accessible to a wide range of learners with different needs from a variety of backgrounds, abilities and learning styles. To ensure this the developed content needs to be checked so that access is optimised and all unnecessary barriers are removed making it inclusive and easier to engage with by all learners including people with disabilities. Accessible educational materials (AEM) are defined as educational materials that are designed or later enhanced in such a way that it makes them usable across the widest range of learner variability. For digital learning materials and technologies this means that they are accessible if they can be easily used by anyone, including people with disabilities. Accessible digital learning materials need to be designed so that they can be directly used without assistive technology or made usable with assistive technology. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for accessible materials: simple text structure helps learners with a variety of learning needs, including learners for whom the language used is not their native language simple navigation through the materials should help access the content from mobile devices, as well as learners with low vision adding captions to videos helps learners with hearing impairment as well as learners that have low prior knowledge on the subject and key terminology. General guidelines for development of accessible materials Most of the techniques used for development of accessible learning materials are based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) that focuses on the design of learning materials that are aimed to be inclusive of as many learners as possible. This approach, combined with the assistive and accessible technologies, can ensure that every learner has access to the same materials. UDL is based on three fundamental principles: Multiple means of representation learning content should be presented in different ways and formats Multiple means of action and expression several options for action and expression should support the demonstration of acquired knowledge Multiple means of engagement learners differ in what engages and motivates them so multiple options should be provided The following are some general tips and guidelines that should help develop accessible learning content: Present the information in multiple ways and formats This helps support various learning styles and provides alternatives for different impairments. Use simple language The materials should be accessible for the learners' varying levels of access, background, and ability. An option is to provide additional resources to support learners that have comprehension difficulties. Use headings Assistive technologies differentiate the structural elements in the text (body text and different levels of headings). These help screen readers process the text correctly. Use table of content Helps learners navigate to the required information easily. Provide alternative text for images The alternative text is read by the screen reader instead of the image. Decorative images should be marked as decorative so that the screen reader can skip them. Use equation editors for math expressions This format helps screen readers understand the content. Use a high contrast color palette High contrast supports learners with vision impairments. Don't use color as the only way to convey information Provide other alternative means for color blind learners. Use descriptive links Links to other documents should explain where the link is taking the learner. Use tables only when required If a table is truly the best way to convey the information and not just a layout trick, then use column and row headers to describe the content. Provide closed captions and transcripts Helps make the information in the video accessible to the vision impaired. Alternative text tips and tricks For tip on how to write alternative text for images study the Alternative text guide by WebAIM . The key takeaways in the guide include: alternative text should be accurate and equivalent in representing content and function alternative text should be succinct alternative text should not be redundant alternative text should not include phrases such as \"image of ...\" or \"graphic of ...\" Decorative images should have blank alternative text. A decorative image is an image that does not present important content is used for layout or non-informative purposes does not have a function (e.g. is not a link) Use accessibility evaluation tools! Accessibility evaluation tools are not perfect. Even if they say that all is ok, it does not mean that your content is truly accessible. But they are a very good starting point. Slides Use the integrated accessibility checker in Power Point: Open an existing presentation in PowerPoint and review the content. Select the Review tab. Select Check Accessibility. An Accessibility Checker pane will appear on the right with 'Inspection Results' displayed. Web content Choose from the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List developed by W3C. PDF document Check accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Pro. Open the PDF and then from the All tools menu on the left, select View more and then select Prepare for accessibility. Summary To create an engaging and inclusive learning experience, it\u2019s essential to understand and integrate various learning modalities, incorporate multimedia effectively, and ensure accessibility. Learning modalities include visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and read/write styles, each catering to different ways individuals process information. By incorporating multimedia elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content, educators can address diverse learning preferences and enrich the educational experience. This not only helps in accommodating various learning styles but also makes the content more engaging and dynamic. Ensuring accessibility is crucial in making learning resources usable for all individuals, including those with disabilities. This involves using descriptive alt text for images, providing transcripts and captions for audio and video content, and ensuring high color contrast and responsive design. Additionally, interactive elements should be navigable via keyboard, and semantic HTML should be employed to aid screen readers in interpreting content. By following these best practices, educational content becomes more inclusive, allowing all learners to access and benefit from the material effectively.

They help users quickly identify key points or notes. Use Admonitions to Highlight Key Information. Code blocks can also be used to provide source code examples to learners. Integrating Jupyter Notebooks with MkDocs can provide a powerful way to combine interactive code, data analysis, and documentation. This is particularly useful for projects that involve both technical explanations and live code examples. To mix MD with Jupyter Notebooks you can: Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown or HTML Jupyter Notebooks can be converted to Markdown or HTML, which can then be included in your MkDocs site. Use nbviewer or GitHub Gists for Live Notebooks services like nbviewer or GitHub Gists to embed live notebooks, such as [View Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/username/repository/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) Use jupyter-book for a Comprehensive Solution consider using jupyter-book, which is designed to work with Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown to create interactive books. also, the jupyter-mkdocs plugin enables you to run Jupyter Notebooks directly within MkDocs. Final Tips Maintain a Consistent Style : Use consistent image sizes, captions, and positioning throughout your content. Test Compatibility : Ensure that the multimedia elements work in the Markdown processor or platform you\u2019re using. Responsive Design : Ensure that your multimedia content is responsive, especially when using HTML, so that it looks good on different screen sizes.

To ensure this the developed content needs to be checked so that access is optimised and all unnecessary barriers are removed making it inclusive and easier to engage with by all learners including people with disabilities. Accessible educational materials (AEM) are defined as educational materials that are designed or later enhanced in such a way that it makes them usable across the widest range of learner variability. For digital learning materials and technologies this means that they are accessible if they can be easily used by anyone, including people with disabilities. Accessible digital learning materials need to be designed so that they can be directly used without assistive technology or made usable with assistive technology. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for accessible materials: simple text structure helps learners with a variety of learning needs, including learners for whom the language used is not their native language simple navigation through the materials should help access the content from mobile devices, as well as learners with low vision adding captions to videos helps learners with hearing impairment as well as learners that have low prior knowledge on the subject and key terminology.","title":"Accessibility"},{"location":"1st%20Session/06%20Rich%20learning%20exp/Rich%20learning%20experience/#general-guidelines-for-development-of-accessible-materials","text":"Most of the techniques used for development of accessible learning materials are based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) that focuses on the design of learning materials that are aimed to be inclusive of as many learners as possible. This approach, combined with the assistive and accessible technologies, can ensure that every learner has access to the same materials. UDL is based on three fundamental principles: Multiple means of representation learning content should be presented in different ways and formats Multiple means of action and expression several options for action and expression should support the demonstration of acquired knowledge Multiple means of engagement learners differ in what engages and motivates them so multiple options should be provided The following are some general tips and guidelines that should help develop accessible learning content: Present the information in multiple ways and formats This helps support various learning styles and provides alternatives for different impairments. Use simple language The materials should be accessible for the learners' varying levels of access, background, and ability. An option is to provide additional resources to support learners that have comprehension difficulties. Use headings Assistive technologies differentiate the structural elements in the text (body text and different levels of headings). These help screen readers process the text correctly. Use table of content Helps learners navigate to the required information easily. Provide alternative text for images The alternative text is read by the screen reader instead of the image. Decorative images should be marked as decorative so that the screen reader can skip them. Use equation editors for math expressions This format helps screen readers understand the content. Use a high contrast color palette High contrast supports learners with vision impairments. Don't use color as the only way to convey information Provide other alternative means for color blind learners. Use descriptive links Links to other documents should explain where the link is taking the learner. Use tables only when required If a table is truly the best way to convey the information and not just a layout trick, then use column and row headers to describe the content. Provide closed captions and transcripts Helps make the information in the video accessible to the vision impaired.","title":"General guidelines for development of accessible materials"},{"location":"1st%20Session/06%20Rich%20learning%20exp/Rich%20learning%20experience/#alternative-text-tips-and-tricks","text":"For tip on how to write alternative text for images study the Alternative text guide by WebAIM .

Learning modalities include visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and read/write styles, each catering to different ways individuals process information. By incorporating multimedia elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content, educators can address diverse learning preferences and enrich the educational experience. This not only helps in accommodating various learning styles but also makes the content more engaging and dynamic. Ensuring accessibility is crucial in making learning resources usable for all individuals, including those with disabilities. This involves using descriptive alt text for images, providing transcripts and captions for audio and video content, and ensuring high color contrast and responsive design.

Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protects the interests of the creators and owners by providing them with rights over their creation. For the purposes of creation of learning materials, the copyright and related rights main branches of IPR are used. They are defined to protect literary and artistic creations, performances, phonograms by defining the authors\u2019, owners\u2019, performers\u2019, producers\u2019 and broadcasters\u2019 rights. In some cases additional IPR branches might be involved. Copyright Original work can be protected by copyright law that grants the owner exclusive right to control certain rights such as reproduction. The copyright is owned jointly by all authors, or it may be owned by the employing institution. Any work that you create by default makes you or your institution/employer the copyright holder of it. Use of copyright protected work requires permission from the owner . Permission may not be required in the case of works licensed in the public domain and uses covered by Copyright Exceptions. Only the copyright holder is allowed to distribute whatever is created. If you want to transfer this right to other people as well, you can do that via a license. In absence of exceptions or limitations, one can reuse an existing work if it is licensed to the user or it is licensed to the public using a public license such as the Creative Commons (CC) licenses or Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) licenses . Licensing The content in this section contains material taken from: CC FAQ website licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license Creative Commons license Wikipage (2023, June 21) in Wikipedia licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0 A license allows you to define rights and obligations regarding the use of your work. One of the best sources of information for licensing reusable learning materials is Creative Commons . There are many available CC License options which are based on the four baseline rights. It is recommended that the least restrictive CC BY 4.0 license , requiring only that credit is given to the creator when reusing, is used when creating new learning materials. The ND right falls into the opposite extreme and is not recommended for FAIR learning materials licensing as it severely limits their reusability in adaptations. Public domain licensing (CC0) is also not recommended as different rules apply in different countries. The CC License Chooser tool helps authors share their work in a standardised way providing copyright licenses that enable sharing and reuse of the creative work under the chosen conditions. To apply a license all you have to do is indicate which CC license you are applying to your work. You should then check the terms of the chosen license and comply with the requirements therein. For an example, it is strongly recommended to include a link to the relevant CC license deed (e.g., https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). Example is provided below: Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Commons Attribution 4.0 International License Respect the licenses, to be respected!\u200b Materials with non-permissable licenses can be used for inspiration only. Materials with permissable licenses should be reused based on the license rules. Attribution and Citing The right to attribution is a moral right of the authors that protects the personal relationship between the author and the created work even if the creator does not own the copyright. For work created by others that you are incorporating into your own work you want to make it easy for others to know who created what parts of the work. In other words, acknowledgement of the reused materials through attribution is always needed (even if it is not a requirement of the license, such as the public domain licenses). One condition that is required for all CC licenses is attribution. The ideal attribution follows the TASL approach: T itle - what is the name of the work A uthor - who allows you to use the work (name and link) S ource - where can the work be found (link added to title) L icense - how can the work be used (name and link to the license) If your work is a modification or adaptation of another work, indicate this and provide attribution to the creator of the original work. You should also include a link to the work you modified and indicate what license applies to that work. Citing A citation allows authors to provide the source of any quotations, ideas, and information that they include in their own work based on the copyrighted works of other authors. However, in the case of using direct quotations with citing, it is essential that the amount of information referenced is very limited. In addition, it is recommended to quote works that were already made available to the public in a lawful way and, when possible, to provide the original source and the author's name. Depending on the country, the reproduction and communication of a protected work may be carried out for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source, including the author's name, is indicated, unless this turns out to be impossible and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved. Plan to reuse existing material? Check the license The existing material is available under a CC license, but it is different than the one you plan to use for your materials... I want to reuse it as a whole I want to reuse a small part of it You can't use something that is licensed with ND (no derivatives). In this case you must follow the rules on combining and adapting CC material. Read more... No problem, you can reuse any existing CC licensed material in your learning materials as long as the reused portion is used as a showcase or to make a specific point and it is not the core of your work. If the work is licensed with ND, do not modify it while reusing. Go to CC licensing FAQ Attribute All CC licenses require that you attribute the author, and this rule is recommended even if the license is public domain CC-0. If the work you are reusing has a copyright notice (\"\u00a9 some text\") you need to reproduce it while you credit the work. You should also be able to remove attribution upon request. Use the authors recommended attribution Use TASL Examples If the original author has provided a cite-as information, use it to attribute the work. Provide the Title, Author, Source and License of the work that you are reusing. Source is the URL to the original work. If there is a URL to the author personal pages, provide it together with the name. Provide the name of the license and a URL to the license.

Defining How to cite Citation files are plain text files with human- and machine-readable citation information that tells others how to cite or attribute your work. There is a an open source project that defines the Citation File Format (CFF) in a CITATION.cff file so that there is a structured, uniform way of decribing how others should cite your work. CITATION.cff is written in a YAML format and has controlled vocabularies for most of the supported fields. The purpose of this file is to provide information on how the materials (Git repository) should be cited. Its content, among other things, also controls the text shown when the Cite this repository button is clicked on the right hand side of a GitHub repository's homepage. Create your own citation file The citation file is a specific file wherein you need to provide the correct information so that it can be correctly processed.

Copyright automatically applies to original works, requiring permission for reuse unless the work is in the public domain or covered by specific exceptions. Licensing, especially through Creative Commons (CC), provides a way for creators to define how others can use their work. Attribution and citation are crucial for recognizing and respecting the original creators. All CC licenses mandate attribution, which can be effectively managed using the TASL approach\u2014Title, Author, Source, and License. Proper citation ensures legal compliance and honors the intellectual contributions of others. The use of CITATION.cff files is also encouraged, as they provide a standardized format for describing how a work should be cited, which is particularly useful in open-source projects and for maintaining consistent citation practices across platforms.

It\u2019s essential to consider the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) from the outset to ensure that the materials will meet these standards. Planning also includes determining the resources, tools, and collaborators needed for the project. Discover During the discovery stage, existing resources and gaps in available materials are identified. This involves researching existing content, tools, and technologies that can be reused or adapted. The goal is to avoid duplicating efforts by leveraging available resources and ensuring that the new materials fill an identified need in the community. Design The design stage focuses on structuring the educational materials in a way that aligns with FAIR principles. This includes organizing content to be easily searchable (Findable), ensuring it can be accessed by a wide range of users (Accessible), using standardized formats and protocols for compatibility with various systems (Interoperable), and creating modular content that can be repurposed (Reusable). Metadata and documentation play crucial roles in this stage, helping to maintain the integrity and usability of the materials. Produce In the production stage, the actual creation of the educational materials takes place. This involves developing the content according to the design specifications, using the selected tools and formats. Ensuring that the materials adhere to the planned structure and meet the FAIR principles is key during this phase. Collaboration and feedback from team members or stakeholders may also be integrated into the production process. Publish Once the materials are created, they are published on appropriate platforms that support accessibility and interoperability. This stage also includes attaching the necessary metadata, licenses, and documentation to ensure that the content is Findable and Reusable by others. Publishing on open-access platforms or repositories is encouraged to maximize the reach and impact of the materials. Verify After publication, the materials are assessed for their adherence to FAIR principles.

It is very important to keep them updating and improving. But doing so, creates other challenges such as version management. The FAIR-by-Design Methodology uses Git as a versioning system, providing industry standard version management. Each new Git release is considered a new version of the learning materials. When doing so, it is very important to keep track of the changes made, as well as to have consistent version numbering system. Version Management Git is the most popular version management system in use today. It is available for all popular platforms either as a first-party command line utility or through third-party graphical user interface (GUI) clients. Git uses the concept of repositories which can granularly manage the versions of all objects placed within it. File changes are committed to a repository and each commit is automatically associated a unique and random identifier. In addition to this identifier, each commit is also described by its author, commit title and commit description. A single Git repository can be used by multiple users, each contributing and committing their changes. To produce a new training material, one should fork the template repository, or the repository of any other ready made training material. It is important to note that each commit to the repository, triggers the actions needed to update the associated Gitbook. Each new Github release produces a new version of the learning material. By default, the Gitbook shows the latest version (visible also in the URL as /latest). The dropdown list on the top of every Git page enables quick access to all previous versions. Git commit A granular change of a single or multiple files in the repository, identified by a random unique identifier, the committer's name, email address, short commit title and an optional longer commit description. A commit can contain file additions, modifications, removal, or relocation to a different directory. Git clone An action to download locally an existing Git repository. A repository hosted on a public Git hosting service such as GitHub can be cloned by anyone (assuming it is public) on their local machines. Once downloaded, users can explore the repository and optionally send their contributed changes upstream, if they have been assigned the necessary permissions. Git fork A 1:1 copy of an existing Git repository. A fork of an existing repository results with the creation of a brand new repository which will have a shared history with the original one up until the fork was made. The owner of the forked repository will be the user who initiated the fork. The original owner of the repository does not have any right in the forked repository by default. Git release Each git release creates a new observable version of the Gitpages, as well as a new record (for the first release), or an updated record in Zenodo. Release Notes The release notes for each new version are intended to help the users of these materials to better understand the changes brought by each version. They can be useful both for the learners and for the instructors using the materials. Using the release notes enables tracking of all the versions of a learning material. They are written in a special Markdown file called RELEASE_NOTES.md . The content of this file is embedded as is on the Git book homepage (the syllabus) in a collapsible block. Ideally, the RELEASE_NOTES.md file should list the various versions in a descending order, sorted by the release date. Example of a RELEASE_NOTES.md content for the FAIR-by-Design Training of Trainers course. . New iteration The work on a new iteration starts once the list of identified improvements that will be incorporated into the new version is finalised. The next step is to organise the work regarding the required changes to the learning materials. Depending on the identified improvements, the changes may bring you back to the Produce stage implementing changes in learning units, or even to Design if restructuring of the learning material is needed. The version number is one of the things that you will need to provide when activating a new release. The recommendation based on best practices is to keep the versioning in the Major.Minor.Patch version number sequence. You will increment the minor number if the incremental improvement does not change the overall structure of the learning materials. You will increment the major number if the changes include change in the overall structure of the learning materials. Increment the Patch number in case of only technical fixes.

Summary Using version management, as well as clearly documented changes between the versions help both learners and instructors using a specific learning material. Producing a new version might include changes from quite small to quite significant ones. These should be reflected in the proper version numbering, and clearly explained in the accompanied files. The automated workflows that are part of the Methodology enable consistency between the Git repositories and the published releases on the Zenodo platform.

It is essential that there are mechanisms in place that can help learners obtain digital credentials reflecting their current skillsets. Learning Objectives discuss criteria for issuing digital credentials identify options for digital credentials Introduction The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework is designed to support the professional development and recognition of skills within the Open Science ecosystem. As Open Science becomes increasingly integral to research and data management across Europe, there is a growing need for a consistent and reliable way to certify the skills and competencies of professionals involved in this field. The framework addresses this need by providing a standardized approach to the use of digital credentials. Key Aspects of the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework: Digital Credentials : The framework leverages digital credentials, such as badges and certificates, to provide tangible, verifiable proof of skills. These credentials are awarded based on specific achievements, such as completing training programs, passing assessments, or demonstrating particular competencies. Digital credentials are designed to be easily shareable, allowing professionals to include them in their CVs, LinkedIn profiles, or other online portfolios. This enhances the visibility and recognition of their skills across the European research community and beyond. Supporting Open Science Professionals : The framework is tailored to meet the needs of various stakeholders in the Open Science ecosystem, including researchers, data stewards, librarians, and other research support staff. It recognizes both formal and informal learning, offering flexibility in how skills are acquired and validated. This is particularly important in a rapidly evolving field like Open Science, where new tools, methods, and practices are constantly emerging. For Instructors and Learners : Instructors: The framework provides instructors with a way to certify the competencies they impart to their learners, helping to establish their credibility and expertise in Open Science. Learners: For learners, the framework offers a clear pathway to gaining and demonstrating the skills necessary for working effectively in Open Science. The credentials serve as proof of their proficiency, whether they are early-career researchers or experienced professionals expanding their skill set. Employer Recognition Across Europe : One of the core goals of the framework is to ensure that these digital credentials are recognized by employers across Europe. By establishing a common standard, the framework makes it easier for employers to assess and validate the skills of potential hires, regardless of their location or the specific training programs they have completed. This cross-border recognition is crucial for fostering mobility and collaboration within the European Research Area (ERA), enabling professionals to move between countries and institutions while maintaining the value of their credentials. Integration with Existing Initiatives : The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework is designed to align with other European initiatives, such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) framework, and the European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDCL) system. This integration helps ensure that the credentials are interoperable and widely accepted. Promoting Lifelong Learning : The framework encourages lifelong learning by recognizing continuous professional development. Professionals can earn credentials as they acquire new skills over time, helping them stay current with the latest developments in Open Science and related fields. Contributing to a Sustainable Open Science Ecosystem : By promoting the recognition of skills and competencies, the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework contributes to the sustainability of the Open Science ecosystem. It supports the development of a skilled workforce that can drive the adoption and implementation of Open Science practices across Europe. The current version of the Recognition Framework is still in its draft phase and is available on Zenodo together with a link that asks for your feedback . Criteria for issuing digital credentials Providing digital credentials, such as badges or certificates, can recognize both attendance at training and the successful completion of assessments. However, each approach has its own pros and cons. Digital Credentials for Attendance Only Pros: Encourages Participation : Offering credentials for attendance can motivate more individuals to participate in training sessions, as they receive recognition simply for being present. Inclusivity : It allows all participants, regardless of their performance in assessments, to receive a credential, promoting inclusivity and reducing the pressure of assessment. Easy to Administer : These credentials are straightforward to issue, as they do not require the evaluation of participant performance, reducing administrative overhead. Building a Learning Culture : Recognizing attendance can contribute to a culture of continuous learning, encouraging individuals to engage in more training opportunities. Cons: Limited Value : Credentials for attendance may carry less weight since they do not necessarily indicate that the recipient has gained or demonstrated any specific skills or knowledge. Potentially Misleading : These credentials could be misleading if interpreted as a sign of competency when they only signify participation. Lack of Differentiation : There is no distinction between those who merely attend and those who actively engage and master the material, potentially diminishing the credential\u2019s perceived value. Digital Credentials for Successful Completion of Assessment Pros: Demonstrates Competency : These credentials indicate that the recipient has not only attended the training but also successfully demonstrated understanding and application of the material, making them more meaningful and valuable. Higher Recognition : Credentials based on assessment are often more respected by employers and peers, as they provide evidence of skills and knowledge. Motivates Learning : Knowing that they must pass an assessment to receive a credential can motivate participants to engage more deeply with the training content. Differentiates Skill Levels : This approach differentiates between those who have mastered the material and those who have not, which can be important in professional or academic settings. Cons: Excludes Some Participants : Those who struggle with assessments may not receive a credential, which could discourage participation and be seen as less inclusive. Increased Pressure : Participants may feel more stressed or anxious about assessments, which could negatively impact their learning experience. More Complex Administration : Administering assessments and issuing credentials based on performance requires more resources, including time, effort, and sometimes technology, to ensure fair and accurate evaluation. Risk of Credential Inflation : If not carefully designed, assessments could lead to credential inflation, where the credential becomes less valuable due to inconsistent or low standards. The choice between awarding digital credentials for attendance versus successful completion of assessments depends on the goals of the training program and the value you want to convey through the credentials. If the aim is to encourage broad participation and foster a learning culture, attendance-based credentials might be more suitable. However, if the goal is to ensure that participants acquire and demonstrate specific skills or knowledge, credentials tied to assessment performance are more appropriate. Digital Credentials The two viable options proposed by the Recognition Framework are the Open Digital Badges and the European Digital Credentials. One can choose one of these types or even implement both of them as they are complementary in some aspects. Open Digital Badges Open Digital Badges are digital representations of achievements, skills, or knowledge that an individual has earned. These badges are often issued by educational institutions, employers, or professional organizations and can be shared across various platforms, such as social media, digital resumes, or professional networks. Each Open Digital Badge contains metadata that includes information about the issuing organization, the criteria for earning the badge, the date of issue, and sometimes evidence of the achievement (such as a project or assessment). Badges are issued through a digital credentialing platform and can be verified by anyone viewing the badge, ensuring authenticity and credibility. Open Badge content by 1EdTech , licensed under CC-BY-4.0 Pros: Portability : Easily shared and displayed across multiple platforms. Transparency : Contains detailed metadata that verifies the achievement. Motivational : Encourages learners by providing tangible recognition of their accomplishments. Flexibility : Can represent a wide range of achievements, from formal education to micro-credentials. Cons: Varied Standards : Different issuers may have different criteria for awarding badges, leading to inconsistencies. Recognition : Not all employers or institutions may recognize or value badges equally. Overwhelming : The proliferation of badges can make it difficult for employers to assess their true value. European Digital Credentials European Digital Credentials (EDCs) are a standardized form of digital certification recognized across the European Union. These credentials can represent educational qualifications, skills, or professional achievements and are designed to be interoperable across borders and institutions within the EU. EDCs are issued by accredited institutions and include standardized metadata, ensuring consistency and interoperability across the EU. The credentials are verified through a secure digital infrastructure supported by the European Commission, making them trustworthy and easily portable between EU countries. Image taken from https://europa.eu/europass/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials Pros: Standardization : Provides a consistent framework for recognizing qualifications across Europe. Trustworthy : Issued and verified by accredited institutions, ensuring high credibility. Interoperability : Recognized across all EU member states, facilitating mobility and cross-border employment. Integration : Can be integrated into national and EU-level qualifications frameworks. Cons: Limited Scope : Primarily focused on formal qualifications and may not cover informal or micro-credentials as effectively as badges. Bureaucracy : The process of issuing and verifying EDCs can be more complex and time-consuming. Flexibility : Less flexible compared to open digital badges, particularly for informal learning achievements. Comparison Recognition and Scope : EDCs are more standardized and recognized across the EU, especially for formal qualifications, while Open Digital Badges are more flexible and can represent a broader range of achievements, including informal learning. Flexibility : Open Digital Badges are more adaptable to various types of learning and achievements, whereas EDCs are more rigid but offer higher standardization. Portability : Both are portable, but EDCs have an edge in cross-border recognition within the EU due to their standardized framework. Credibility : EDCs generally have higher credibility due to their issuance by accredited institutions and standardized verification process, while Open Digital Badges\u2019 credibility can vary depending on the issuer. Open Digital Badges and European Digital Credentials both serve as digital representations of skills and achievements but cater to different needs. Open Digital Badges are versatile, allowing for recognition of a wide array of learning experiences, but they may suffer from inconsistency and varying levels of recognition. European Digital Credentials, on the other hand, provide a highly standardized and credible form of certification recognized across the EU, making them ideal for formal qualifications but less adaptable to informal or micro-credentials. The choice between the two depends on the specific needs for recognition, portability, and the type of learning being credentialed. Summary The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework aims to standardize the use of digital credentials to provide Open Science professionals, both instructors and learners, with verifiable proof of their skills. This framework also enables employers across Europe to recognize and validate these competencies, ensuring consistent standards and fostering professional development in the field of Open Science. Do not forget that the final version of the Recognition Framework is due to be out in March 2025.

As Open Science becomes increasingly integral to research and data management across Europe, there is a growing need for a consistent and reliable way to certify the skills and competencies of professionals involved in this field. The framework addresses this need by providing a standardized approach to the use of digital credentials. Key Aspects of the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework: Digital Credentials : The framework leverages digital credentials, such as badges and certificates, to provide tangible, verifiable proof of skills. These credentials are awarded based on specific achievements, such as completing training programs, passing assessments, or demonstrating particular competencies. Digital credentials are designed to be easily shareable, allowing professionals to include them in their CVs, LinkedIn profiles, or other online portfolios. This enhances the visibility and recognition of their skills across the European research community and beyond. Supporting Open Science Professionals : The framework is tailored to meet the needs of various stakeholders in the Open Science ecosystem, including researchers, data stewards, librarians, and other research support staff. It recognizes both formal and informal learning, offering flexibility in how skills are acquired and validated. This is particularly important in a rapidly evolving field like Open Science, where new tools, methods, and practices are constantly emerging. For Instructors and Learners : Instructors: The framework provides instructors with a way to certify the competencies they impart to their learners, helping to establish their credibility and expertise in Open Science. Learners: For learners, the framework offers a clear pathway to gaining and demonstrating the skills necessary for working effectively in Open Science. The credentials serve as proof of their proficiency, whether they are early-career researchers or experienced professionals expanding their skill set. Employer Recognition Across Europe : One of the core goals of the framework is to ensure that these digital credentials are recognized by employers across Europe. By establishing a common standard, the framework makes it easier for employers to assess and validate the skills of potential hires, regardless of their location or the specific training programs they have completed. This cross-border recognition is crucial for fostering mobility and collaboration within the European Research Area (ERA), enabling professionals to move between countries and institutions while maintaining the value of their credentials. Integration with Existing Initiatives : The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework is designed to align with other European initiatives, such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) framework, and the European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDCL) system. This integration helps ensure that the credentials are interoperable and widely accepted. Promoting Lifelong Learning : The framework encourages lifelong learning by recognizing continuous professional development. Professionals can earn credentials as they acquire new skills over time, helping them stay current with the latest developments in Open Science and related fields. Contributing to a Sustainable Open Science Ecosystem : By promoting the recognition of skills and competencies, the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework contributes to the sustainability of the Open Science ecosystem. It supports the development of a skilled workforce that can drive the adoption and implementation of Open Science practices across Europe. The current version of the Recognition Framework is still in its draft phase and is available on Zenodo together with a link that asks for your feedback .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"2nd%20Session%20-%20Under%20Development/03%20Recognition/recognition/#criteria-for-issuing-digital-credentials","text":"Providing digital credentials, such as badges or certificates, can recognize both attendance at training and the successful completion of assessments. However, each approach has its own pros and cons.","title":"Criteria for issuing digital credentials"},{"location":"2nd%20Session%20-%20Under%20Development/03%20Recognition/recognition/#digital-credentials-for-attendance-only","text":"Pros: Encourages Participation : Offering credentials for attendance can motivate more individuals to participate in training sessions, as they receive recognition simply for being present. Inclusivity : It allows all participants, regardless of their performance in assessments, to receive a credential, promoting inclusivity and reducing the pressure of assessment. Easy to Administer : These credentials are straightforward to issue, as they do not require the evaluation of participant performance, reducing administrative overhead. Building a Learning Culture : Recognizing attendance can contribute to a culture of continuous learning, encouraging individuals to engage in more training opportunities. Cons: Limited Value : Credentials for attendance may carry less weight since they do not necessarily indicate that the recipient has gained or demonstrated any specific skills or knowledge. Potentially Misleading : These credentials could be misleading if interpreted as a sign of competency when they only signify participation. Lack of Differentiation : There is no distinction between those who merely attend and those who actively engage and master the material, potentially diminishing the credential\u2019s perceived value.","title":"Digital Credentials for Attendance Only"},{"location":"2nd%20Session%20-%20Under%20Development/03%20Recognition/recognition/#digital-credentials-for-successful-completion-of-assessment","text":"Pros: Demonstrates Competency : These credentials indicate that the recipient has not only attended the training but also successfully demonstrated understanding and application of the material, making them more meaningful and valuable. Higher Recognition : Credentials based on assessment are often more respected by employers and peers, as they provide evidence of skills and knowledge. Motivates Learning : Knowing that they must pass an assessment to receive a credential can motivate participants to engage more deeply with the training content. Differentiates Skill Levels : This approach differentiates between those who have mastered the material and those who have not, which can be important in professional or academic settings. Cons: Excludes Some Participants : Those who struggle with assessments may not receive a credential, which could discourage participation and be seen as less inclusive. Increased Pressure : Participants may feel more stressed or anxious about assessments, which could negatively impact their learning experience. More Complex Administration : Administering assessments and issuing credentials based on performance requires more resources, including time, effort, and sometimes technology, to ensure fair and accurate evaluation. Risk of Credential Inflation : If not carefully designed, assessments could lead to credential inflation, where the credential becomes less valuable due to inconsistent or low standards. The choice between awarding digital credentials for attendance versus successful completion of assessments depends on the goals of the training program and the value you want to convey through the credentials. If the aim is to encourage broad participation and foster a learning culture, attendance-based credentials might be more suitable. However, if the goal is to ensure that participants acquire and demonstrate specific skills or knowledge, credentials tied to assessment performance are more appropriate.","title":"Digital Credentials for Successful Completion of Assessment"},{"location":"2nd%20Session%20-%20Under%20Development/03%20Recognition/recognition/#digital-credentials","text":"The two viable options proposed by the Recognition Framework are the Open Digital Badges and the European Digital Credentials.

To prepare for this, a set of files needs to be manually edited, making sure all the necessary information needed to accompany the materials is present. The methodology also uses the FAIR signposting, enabling metadata to be present in the resulting html files. Repository choice The FAIR-by-Design Methodology opted for using Zenodo as a open access repository, but other communities and users can use different repositories, suitable for their purpose. Files Description The FAIR-by-Design templates repository contains the accompanying files which we will need to alter: README.md CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md Licence.txt Contributors These files can be altered in any order desired, as long as making sure that they have all been covered. README.md is a Markdown file which should briefly describe the repository, so that first time visitors can get an initial idea what it is about. The README.md file's content is shown immediately below the directory browser on the repository's homepage. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md , as its name suggests, describes the contributors' code of conduct which needs to be adhered to. It defines standards for how to engage in a community. It can also contain steps for resoling issues between members of the community. GitHub also shows a direct link to a repository's code of conduct (if available) above the citation information. The Licence.txt file contains the description of the license under which the training material is released. If you have been creating your own repo from scratch or cloned the templates repo, most probably the current license you have in your repo at the moment is CC0. If you have decided that you will use another license (compatible with the reused material, derived using the adapter's license rules, etc.) then you need to replace the LICENSE file in your repository with the correct one. The contente of the license file can be downloaded from the Plaintext versions of Creative Commons 4.0 licenses The FAIR-by-Design Methodology does not use any separate files and roles for the contributors, other than the ones in the RDA Metadata. However, even thou there is not a standardised taxonomy for the contributors and roles, Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) can be helpful. The All Contributors specification defines that Open source projects should include the following mandatory items to support the All Contributors specification: A \"Contributors\" section in a prominent site of the project repository documentation that includes a list of all project contributors The goal should be to use the most prominent site of the project documentation when feasible. In many cases, this is the project README file Consider using a CONTRIBUTORS file in the top level of the repository when the number of project contributors exceeds a level at which it is unfeasible to use the README file to acknowledge contributions. In this case, a prominent link to the CONTRIBUTORS file should be included on the README page under the \"Contributors\" heading The listings should be formatted as a table with the following information about the project contributors: Name URL link to a site where more information can be learned about the contributor. This URL may be determined by the contributor at the project's discretion. An indication of the Contribution Category in text or icon image format using the defined Contribution Categories and/or Contribution Categories emoji images (see below). A link to the Contribution Category in text or emoji format using the defined Contribution Categories and/or Contribution Categories emoji . The list of contributors can be spread across multiple lines (each technically being its table) as needed. The order of contributors is immaterial to the spec. Order them how you wish. Contributors example Example use of contributors and their roles can be seen in the Galaxy Project Training Network - GTN . FAIR Signposting Signposting , presents a lightweight, but powerful approach to increase the FAIRness of learning materials. Landing pages of learning materials support humans interaction with learning materials on the web, by providing descriptive metadata and links to content. Signposting helps machine agents by providing this information, and more, in a standards-based way. It contributes to FAIR's Findable, Accessible, and Reusable by uniformly conveying to machines what the persistent identifier of a scholarly object is, where its landing page is, where and what its content is, where metadata that describes it is, and what the persistent identifier of its author is. It conveys this by means of meaningful links that have web locations (HTTP URIs) as their target. There are two levels of compliance to FAIR Signposting: Level 1 provide a minimal set of typed links with the landing page as the link origin. Level 2 elevates the compliance by providing a comprehensive set of typed links for landing pages, content, and metadata resources. FAIR Signposting implementation The publishing workflow of the Methodology described below provides an easy way of implementing Signposting for the developed content. Note that the signposting is not mandatory part of the Methodology, but a very useful addition to it. FAIR Signposting output As a result of running the Signposting workflow a linkset.json file is placed in the root of the repository. This file is accessible to crawlers as it is embedded in the meta information in the head of the landing HTML page. Automated publishing workflow The templates repository of the FAIR-by-design Methodology includes a set of Git actions that implement the publishing workflow. The workflow is triggered with each new Github release. When triggered they automate the complete Zenodo publishing process. The steps performed by these actions include: validation of the information provided in the accompanying files, implementation of the signposting, draft entry creation in Zenodo, updating the DOI in all files that reference it, including slides and syllabus, rebuilding and releasing a new version of the Git book. Manual editing In the accompanying files, some of the fields should be edited manually, while others are automatically updated by the publishing workflow and should not be manually changed. Examples of such field are version , doi , date-released from the CITATION.cff . As as result of the successful completion of this workflow the following actions will be performed: new or updated entry in the Zenodo repository updated citation in the Gitpages updated citation.cff file updated FAIR signposting metadata updated citation in the PowerPoint slides (if used) Summary FAIR-by-Design Methodology pays special attention to the publishing of the learning materials, making sure that they conform to the FAIR principles. Several accompanying files are needed to ensure that the required elements are present. Using the Signposting technique, the published html version of the training materials are made understandable not only to humans, but also to the machines - crawlers that process web learning resources. The methodology provides a specific workflow that enables each new release to be clearly visible and added to the Zenodo repository as a new version of the learning materials.

There is always room for improvement and many times need and requirement to keep up to date with the development and changes in the field of subject of the learning materials. Collected feedback from different sources and channels should be a driving force toward the improvement and the release of new versions. Incremental improvements A regular analysis of all QA aspects is necessary to identify potential elements for improvement. Based on the outcomes of the feedback analysis, the authors of the learning materials should make a plan for the development of a new version of the learning materials. Feedback analysis There are multiple sources that can serve for feedback gathering and Quality Assurance. Some sources provide feedback from the learners, some from the fellow instructors that use the training materials. Both are equally important for the further improvements of the learning materials. Most frequently used feedback channel for learners is the feedback form. The form is presented to them just after the training to gather their impressions. In addition to this, learners might opt for direct email contact, as well as discussions and feedback related to more general events like workshops, trainings etc. External Quality Assurance (QA) can provide very valuable input from peers with expertise in the area covered in the training materials. Comments gathered from external contributors bring additional information that can be used to further improve the materials. Externals contributors might also use GitHub issues or discussion forums to provide their view on the materials. Equally important is the own experience of the trainer when delivering the training based on these materials, called self reflection, containing the lessons learned while delivering the training. The input from all of these sources should be gathered and analysed. The results of the analysis should be a list of potential improvements, each marked with an impact level (high, moderate, low). Continuous improvement The next step is to decide which of the improvements will be addressed in the next version and how will this be achieved. Note that depending on the number of identified improvements, you might need to go through the improvement cycle multiple times. It is recommended that the changes are done in an incremental fashion and that changes done in one version are logically related. This help both developers and users to better understand the differences between the versions. Summary Keeping the training materials live and constantly updating them gives them added value.

Some sources provide feedback from the learners, some from the fellow instructors that use the training materials. Both are equally important for the further improvements of the learning materials. Most frequently used feedback channel for learners is the feedback form. The form is presented to them just after the training to gather their impressions. In addition to this, learners might opt for direct email contact, as well as discussions and feedback related to more general events like workshops, trainings etc. External Quality Assurance (QA) can provide very valuable input from peers with expertise in the area covered in the training materials. Comments gathered from external contributors bring additional information that can be used to further improve the materials. Externals contributors might also use GitHub issues or discussion forums to provide their view on the materials. Equally important is the own experience of the trainer when delivering the training based on these materials, called self reflection, containing the lessons learned while delivering the training. The input from all of these sources should be gathered and analysed.

For these purposes you can use the QA guidelines and checklists developed by Skills4EOSC T2.4 . Learning Objectives Upon completing this module the learner should be able to: perform a QA assessment of learning materials rate FAIRness of learning materials Self-check QA Go through the QA checklists In Skills4EOSC T2.4 has developed a number of QA checklists that you and your external reviewer need to go through so that you can ensure high-quality learning materials. The final goal of the FAIR-by-Design instructional design process is to create FAIR learning materials for both learners and instructors. Therefore, it is imperative that you first go through a self-check phase to ensure everything is as intended. For these purposes you can use the QA guidelines and checklists developed by Skills4EOSC . Image by Shahid Abdullah from Pixabay Skills4EOSC has developed a number of QA checklists that should be used for this process, two of which are presented in this text. For the full list of checklists and their use please refer to D2.3 . The three QA checklists that are listed here as part of the verification process are: the general QA checklist that focuses on the learning materials content and analyses it from a learners' perspective the FAIR-by-Design QA checklist that focuses on the FAIR aspects of the learning materials and requirements imposed with the use of the methodology the ELSI checklist that focuses on the ethical, legal and societal issues related to the development of the learning materials General QA The general QA checklist developed by Skills4EOSC addresses the main aspects of the developed learning materials that are related to their quality as perceived by the learners. In the following table these aspects are related to the steps or fields from the FAIR-by-Design methodology to help you understand where, or at which point, this aspect is being addressed by the methodology. Checklist question FAIR-by-Design element Does the learning material title clearly describe what it offers? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material include its goal? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material clearly state its target audience? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material state the level of expertise it is required from its audience? syllabus (metadata) Are the learning objectives/outcomes specific, well-defined, and measurable? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material clearly describe its program / outline? syllabus (metadata) Does the learning material cover different learning styles? learning content Does the learning material states its delivery method?

The questions marked as essential are related to the major FAIR aspects of the obtained learning material. These elements must be present so that the learning materials are achieving bare minimum FAIRness . By complying with the rest of the items you are increasing the FAIRness and quality of the learning materials. Essential Topic Stage FAIR aspect Goal CHECKLIST QUESTION Instructional design process Prepare / Learner-centric learning resources Did you follow the stages of the backward instructional design process while developing the learning resource? YES Schema Prepare Interoperable Choose a metadata schema to describe the material, such as the RDA minimal metadata schema Is the RDA minimal (or domain specific) metadata schema used for the learning material description?

Have you employed a versioning system to track and control changes in your materials? YES Repositories Publish Findable Publish the new version of the learning materials & metadata Is the complete learning resource (including instructors info) registered or indexed in at least one searchable repository? Is it in a FAIR repository? Access rules Publish Accessible Ensure all material is widely accessible by defining open access rules for learning and reuse Are the resource access rules (how to access, e.g. registration procedure) explicitly communicated to learners? YES Access rules Publish Accessible Ensure all material is widely accessible by defining open access rules for learning and reuse Are access rules (authentication & authorisation) implemented for the learning resource? Catalogue Publish Findable Improve findability by creating an entry in a selected training catalogue(s) (thematic, project, regional, general, etc.) Is the learning resource searchable in at least one relevant catalogue? Is it FAIR (can be searched based on metadata)? Cocreation Verify Accessible Enable the possibility to gather feedback and comments from users and peers Does the course include the possibility to provide feedback or comments from users and-or trainers/designers?

QA Verify / external QA Has the learning resource been checked by a third party regarding its learning experience quality? FAIR FAIR Results Does the resource align with the FAIR-by-design methodology principles? ELSI QA checklist The ELSI sub-framework defines the specific features that the Open Science learning resource should include related to Ethical, Legal, and Social issues. To guarantee the quality of the learning resource, it's important to score at least 1 in all the essential indicators. This shows that the resource meets the minimum ELSI quality standards. If the resource does not meet this threshold, more steps are needed to make sure it follows the necessary ELSI requirements. Essential Topic CHECKLIST QUESTION YES Terms of Service Does the resource provide or refer to Terms of Service (ToS)? If so, is the ToS versioned? NO Terms of Service If needed, does the resource provide ToS authentications/registration sections? NO Terms of Service If needed, does the resource provide ToS information about charging and quotas?

YES Ethics Is there attribution to the data source? YES Ethics Is data provenance provided? NO Public Sector Is this resource identified as research data under the Open Data Directive? NO Public Sector Is this resource identified as a High-Value Dataset? External QA A fresh set of eyes Have someone who has not participated in the development of the learning materials review the final work. This will guarantee a review free of cognitive bias. To truly view the produced learning materials through the lenses of learners and other instructors, you need to perform a QA check with the help of an external party. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay To further support this effort the chosen QA reviewer should be an expert that is very well versed in the requirements for engaging learning content and learning styles, as well as the FAIR principles. It is their job as an external QA reviewer to evaluate the learning materials performance, quality, and suggest improvements using an objective and independent perspective. The external QA reviewer can use the Skills4EOSC QA guidelines and checklists as a starting point for the QA, but should be encouraged to go more in-depth with the review process. The high impact recommendations in the QA review report should be resolved as soon as possible. The lower level improvement recommendations can be taken into account as relevant input for the continuous improvement step. Learners experience QA In addition to the checklists the QA review should also ensure that the course available for learners. For instructor-led trainings and courses this must be done before the scheduled training takes place. For these purposes the QA reviewer should assume the role of a learner and try to: access the course information register or self-enrol in the course go through all of the resources available on the course including playing multimedia, quizzes, feedback form and any other type of interaction Any identified problems should be resolved as soon as possible. Summary Performing a QA self-check after publication is an essential step that aims to ensure that all stages of the FAIR-by-Design methodology have been implemented successfully and the learning materials are accessible and presented as planned. The QA guidelines and checklists developed by Skills4EOSC can be extremely helpful when it comes to QA. By engaging an external QA reviewer you are demonstrating your commitment to producing high-quality learning materials and provide accountability to your learners, the instructors community and the public in general.

Applied Language Technology by Tuomo Hiippala; Faculty of Arts, University of Helsinki, Finland Go to the CLARIN Training Session 2 Hands-on folder on Google drive You will find a folder with your name on it, this is your playground Inside there are two google sheets documents that you can use to keep track of your checklists progress each document has three sheets that refer to the three QA frameworks that we discussed Your task is to answer the questions in the frameworks by choosing the possible answers from the dropdown lists reviewing the final score obtained 5 mins before the end of the hands-on you will be asked to answer a few questions about your experience Have fun and remember you can always ask for help! Summary We hope that by engaging in this task, you have not only deepen your understanding of the different quality and FAIRness aspects of learning materials but also gained practical experience in performing QA. This activity was envisioned as an opportunity to bring theory into practice. We encourage you to discuss, collaborate, and make the most of the tools provided as you work through your daily QA challenges. Good luck in your publication and verification efforts! And remember that the FAIR-by-Design Methodology team is here to support you with whatever you might need on your FAIR journey!","title":"Activity"},{"location":"2nd%20Session%20-%20Under%20Development/07%20Hands-on/hands-on/#hands-on-activity","text":"","title":"Hands-on Activity"},{"location":"2nd%20Session%20-%20Under%20Development/07%20Hands-on/hands-on/#learning-objectives","text":"use the QA checklists measure FAIRness of learning objects","title":"Learning Objectives"},{"location":"2nd%20Session%20-%20Under%20Development/07%20Hands-on/hands-on/#introduction","text":"It is time to tune your practical QA skills. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to check the level of quality of two existing learning materials. In other words, you need to try use the provided QA checklists to see what pieces might be missing in the already developed learning materials, are they minimum FAIR and what can be done to improve their FAIRness. As we are not sure that all of you have sufficient experience with GitHub and MD, the template we prepared for you is on Google drive and you can edit it online in your browser.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"2nd%20Session%20-%20Under%20Development/07%20Hands-on/hands-on/#step-by-step-guide","text":"The learning materials which you will analyse in this session are CLARIN Tools and Resources for Lexicographic Work by Francesca Frontini, Andrea Bellandi, Valeria Quochi, Monica Monachini, Karlheinz M\u00f6rth, Susanne Zhanial, Matej \u010eur\u010do and Anna Woldrich (2022).

Use consistent terminology across materials. Get a PID for your materials. Promote Accessibility : Design materials to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use open licenses and ensure content is available in multiple formats (e.g., PDFs, HTML). Foster Interoperability : Use standard open formats and frameworks that allow materials to be easily integrated into different systems. Ensure compatibility with various platforms. Encourage Reusability : Design modular content that can be repurposed for different contexts. Provide clear documentation and guidelines for reuse, ensuring that others can adapt the materials without losing the original intent. this includes plans, assessment details, activities description and facilitation guide Engage the Community : Involve users in the development and refinement of materials. Use feedback loops, such as surveys and discussions, to continually improve the resources. Use Open Tools : Leverage open-source tools for content creation and dissemination to align with FAIR principles and ensure that materials can be widely shared and adapted. Document Your Process : Keep thorough documentation of the creation process, including decisions made regarding content structure, licensing, and technical implementation. This transparency helps others understand and build upon your work. provide information in files such as README, CITATION, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTORS, RELEASE_NOTES, etc. Version Control : Use version control systems like GitHub to manage updates and track changes, ensuring that the most current and relevant materials are always accessible.
