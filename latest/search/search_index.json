This methodology ensures that learning materials, such as course content, training modules, and educational resources, are not only well-structured and high-quality but also meet specific criteria that make them easier to discover, use, and adapt within the Open Science ecosystem. In this way the methodology guarantees that the produced materials will be FAIR not just from the point of view of the learners, but also other designers and trainers that would like to reuse and adapt the materials for their own purposes. FAIR-by-Design Methodology Stages The FAIR-by-Design Methodology is created around the popular backward instructional design process that is used to develop high-quality learner-centric materials. We have taken the steps of the backward instruction design process and added additional considerations to ensure that the process will be aimed towards the design of FAIR learning content from both the perspective of the learners and the perspective of the instructional designers and trainers. The methodology is broken down into a number of stages that are connected in a feedback loop thus enabling continuous improvement: Prepare In the Prepare stage the instructional designers need to expand their skillset so that they can practically implement the FAIR principles . This means that in addition to the traditional instructional design skills, they should also be able to work with PIDs, repositories and catalogues, use a corresponding metadata schema, choose a license, and know how to acknowledge reused work with attribution. One of the important tasks in this stage is to familiarize with the RDA minimal metadata schema for learning resources as this is the basis for the description of the FAIR learning materials. This is when the backward learning process begins: Step 1 : What are your desired effects, i.e. learning outcomes? Step 2 : How are you going to assess the learners' achievements? Step 3 : How should you structure the material to reach them? This is the initial stage of the learning materials development process and thus it is important that in this stage the designer clearly defines the purpose of the learning materials, the target audience and the learning objectives while taking into consideration any prerequisites. Purpose When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes? Target Audience Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context? Prerequisites What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process? Scope Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course? Learning Objectives What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process? Objectives should be S pecific, M easurable, A ttainable, R elevant and T ime-bound. Use Blooms Taxonomy: Formulate the objectives as actionable verb + observable knowledge, skill, attitude, behavior or ability. Discover Once the vision of what needs to be created is clear, the next step is to discover any existing learning materials that can be reused or simply serve as inspiration. For these purposes the designer needs to search different types of repositories that might host similar learning materials including OER repositories, learning platforms, general repositories and catalogues, as well as multimedia repositories that can provide sources of audio/visual props that are essential in multi-modal learning. OER DOAB MERLOT OASIS OER Commons OERTX CORA GALILEO FORRT EOSC_ EOSC Training catalogue on the EOSC Marketplace Most EOSC projects have their own training catalogues and/or platforms... General Creative Commons Search - content provided under a CC license Zenodo - a multi-disciplinary open repository OSF - a free, open research platform Design At this stage the designer has a clear idea of what is needed and what already exists. The next step is to sketch a conceptual map of the learning materials that will help crystalize the ideas and prepare the syllabus for the learning materials. The syllabus is then used as a high-level blueprint for the development of the learning materials. In the design stage the overall structure of the learning materials is defined identifying all modules and learning units necessary together with the information on what can be reused and what needs to be designed from scratch. Careful attention should be put on license compatibility during this work. Tip Create an intuitive logical organisation of all learning materials. Tip The goal is for other people to easily reuse a single item (plan, activity, unit, assessment, ...). Tip Use a hierarchical structure to combine learning units into larger compositions. Upon completing the structure, each learning unit needs to be designed using a modeling technique such as the Hunter's model. The design stage should also take into account the need for development of a facilitation guide that explains in details how to prepare and put the training into practice, as well as a feedback form that should be used to gather feedback after the learning process has finished Produce When the design is complete, it is time to move to the produce stage and choose the tools and file formats necessary to develop all of the content. Care must be taken that the chosen file formats are open so that reusability is supported, and it is recommended that a collaborative, versioning system is used to keep track of all contributions and changes. It is important to consider both the editable files that can be reused by trainers and the final file formats intended for learners. Collaborative environment for team work Choose an environment for producing the learning material that will enable multiple people to work on the same material at one. Two examples are workplace or GitHub (find out more here ). Replicate the folder tree in the environment and start using the provided templates to generate the content. Granular versioning for easy rollback Versioning helps you maintain control over your changes. If the collaborative environment does not provide versioning and history retention then keep a history of the files by adopting a naming convention such as combining the file name with an increasing version number. Open file formats to foster reuse For other people to reuse your materials they should be made available using open file formats (docx, pptx, pdf, md, html, etc.). If you use close file formats then you MUST clearly state the tools that have been used for development in your README file. Multimodal content to reach all audience Don't forget to include different types of multimedia to provide support for different learning modalities: read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic. Two file sets: editable + final Always work with and keep a history of your editable files. These are what matters for you and other instructors. The second set of final files should be obtained from the editable when needed (before distributing them to the learners). The final files should be kept on the learning platform only. In this way you don't need to worry about keeping the versions in sync. Don't forget to support co-creation Truly FAIR learning materials should enable co-creation with external parties. If you don't use a collaborative environment that supports this from the start (such as GitHub), then think how are you going to enable this in the future and how are you going to deal with versioning then. One of the most important aspects of the produce stage is accessibility of the developed learning materials . Accessibility standards should be followed so as to maximize the audience for the learning materials. During this stage the designers must not forget to add the human-readable and machine-readable metadata in the developed content as well as to develop the content of all facilitation documents such as the guide, activities description, lesson plans, etc. The final step in the produce stage is to perform an internal Quality Assessment that will check that all elements are present and that the content is adequate. Publish A satisfactory completion of the internal QA leads to the publication steps. Before the actual publication, very important final touches need to be done including activities such as the definition of the content of accompanying files : license, readme, citation, code of conduct and alike. Accompanying files Define the overall license, provide description, instructions on how to cite your materials, define the code of conduct for a co-creation environment, etc. Put into repository Publish the editable package in an appropriate FAIR repository. This record is primarily intended for reuse by other designers and trainers. Provide to learners Provide the final non-editable versions to the learners on a learning platform of your choice. Verify The final steps in the methodology is to perform another QA round, this time focusing on external QA . At this stage the overall level of FAIRness of the learning materials needs to be checked and external experts should be used to provide unbiased feedback regarding the quality of the produced materials. A fresh set of eyes Have someone who has not participated in the development of the learning materials review the final work. This will guarantee a review free of cognitive bias. Don't forget to QA the Learning Management System (LMS) The reviewer should play the role of a new learner in the LMS and check everything from the learner perspective. Go through the QA checklists In Skills4EOSC T2.4 has developed a number of QA checklists that you and your external reviewer need to go through so that you can ensure high-quality learning materials (see S\u00e1nchez et al. 2023 ). This stage also focuses on setting up different mechanism for gathering feedback so that the learning materials can be further improved. In this way it fosters the co-creation process that empowers learners and other designers and trainers to actively participate in the development. Continuous Improvement The gathered internal and external feedback should be used as input for the development of a new version of the learning materials. Upon the identification of potential improvements that should be implemented, the development process circles back to the first stage aiming to publish a new improved version of the learning materials. Gather Gather feedback from all available internal & external sources. Analyse Analyse the gathered information in a structured way. Create a list of potential improvements with impact level (high, moderate, low). Improve Select items from the list that will be part of a new version. Choose items that make sense to be in the same new release. Repeat Start a new cycle of the FAIR-by-Design methodology that will implement the selected items. After the Verify stage, you will reenter continuous improvement with newly gathered information.... Summary The FAIR-by-Design methodology proposes six stages that aim to ensure that the end result will be FAIR Learning Materials that are: Findable : Learning materials are indexed in a way that makes them easily discoverable by both humans and machines. This typically involves assigning persistent identifiers, such as DOIs, and providing rich metadata that includes detailed descriptions, keywords, and other information that facilitates search and discovery. Accessible : The materials are available to users under clear conditions, often through open access platforms. This means ensuring that the resources can be accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions or licenses, without unnecessary barriers like paywalls or restrictive access conditions. Interoperable : Learning materials are designed to be compatible with various systems and tools. This involves using standardized formats, protocols, and vocabularies that enable the integration and use of the materials across different platforms, enhancing the ability to mix, match, and repurpose content. Reusable : The resources are created with reuse in mind, allowing others to easily adapt or repurpose them for different contexts. This requires clear licensing, proper documentation, and a modular design that facilitates modification and customization.

The methodology is broken down into a number of stages that are connected in a feedback loop thus enabling continuous improvement:","title":"FAIR-by-Design Methodology Stages"},{"location":"1st%20Session/03%20FAIR-by-Design%20Methodology/FAIR-by-Design_content/#prepare","text":"In the Prepare stage the instructional designers need to expand their skillset so that they can practically implement the FAIR principles . This means that in addition to the traditional instructional design skills, they should also be able to work with PIDs, repositories and catalogues, use a corresponding metadata schema, choose a license, and know how to acknowledge reused work with attribution. One of the important tasks in this stage is to familiarize with the RDA minimal metadata schema for learning resources as this is the basis for the description of the FAIR learning materials. This is when the backward learning process begins: Step 1 : What are your desired effects, i.e. learning outcomes? Step 2 : How are you going to assess the learners' achievements? Step 3 : How should you structure the material to reach them? This is the initial stage of the learning materials development process and thus it is important that in this stage the designer clearly defines the purpose of the learning materials, the target audience and the learning objectives while taking into consideration any prerequisites. Purpose When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes? Target Audience Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context? Prerequisites What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process? Scope Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course? Learning Objectives What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process? Objectives should be S pecific, M easurable, A ttainable, R elevant and T ime-bound. Use Blooms Taxonomy: Formulate the objectives as actionable verb + observable knowledge, skill, attitude, behavior or ability.","title":"Prepare"},{"location":"1st%20Session/03%20FAIR-by-Design%20Methodology/FAIR-by-Design_content/#discover","text":"Once the vision of what needs to be created is clear, the next step is to discover any existing learning materials that can be reused or simply serve as inspiration.

The next step is to sketch a conceptual map of the learning materials that will help crystalize the ideas and prepare the syllabus for the learning materials. The syllabus is then used as a high-level blueprint for the development of the learning materials. In the design stage the overall structure of the learning materials is defined identifying all modules and learning units necessary together with the information on what can be reused and what needs to be designed from scratch. Careful attention should be put on license compatibility during this work. Tip Create an intuitive logical organisation of all learning materials. Tip The goal is for other people to easily reuse a single item (plan, activity, unit, assessment, ...). Tip Use a hierarchical structure to combine learning units into larger compositions. Upon completing the structure, each learning unit needs to be designed using a modeling technique such as the Hunter's model. The design stage should also take into account the need for development of a facilitation guide that explains in details how to prepare and put the training into practice, as well as a feedback form that should be used to gather feedback after the learning process has finished","title":"Design"},{"location":"1st%20Session/03%20FAIR-by-Design%20Methodology/FAIR-by-Design_content/#produce","text":"When the design is complete, it is time to move to the produce stage and choose the tools and file formats necessary to develop all of the content. Care must be taken that the chosen file formats are open so that reusability is supported, and it is recommended that a collaborative, versioning system is used to keep track of all contributions and changes. It is important to consider both the editable files that can be reused by trainers and the final file formats intended for learners. Collaborative environment for team work Choose an environment for producing the learning material that will enable multiple people to work on the same material at one. Two examples are workplace or GitHub (find out more here ). Replicate the folder tree in the environment and start using the provided templates to generate the content. Granular versioning for easy rollback Versioning helps you maintain control over your changes. If the collaborative environment does not provide versioning and history retention then keep a history of the files by adopting a naming convention such as combining the file name with an increasing version number. Open file formats to foster reuse For other people to reuse your materials they should be made available using open file formats (docx, pptx, pdf, md, html, etc.). If you use close file formats then you MUST clearly state the tools that have been used for development in your README file. Multimodal content to reach all audience Don't forget to include different types of multimedia to provide support for different learning modalities: read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic. Two file sets: editable + final Always work with and keep a history of your editable files. These are what matters for you and other instructors. The second set of final files should be obtained from the editable when needed (before distributing them to the learners). The final files should be kept on the learning platform only. In this way you don't need to worry about keeping the versions in sync. Don't forget to support co-creation Truly FAIR learning materials should enable co-creation with external parties. If you don't use a collaborative environment that supports this from the start (such as GitHub), then think how are you going to enable this in the future and how are you going to deal with versioning then. One of the most important aspects of the produce stage is accessibility of the developed learning materials . Accessibility standards should be followed so as to maximize the audience for the learning materials. During this stage the designers must not forget to add the human-readable and machine-readable metadata in the developed content as well as to develop the content of all facilitation documents such as the guide, activities description, lesson plans, etc. The final step in the produce stage is to perform an internal Quality Assessment that will check that all elements are present and that the content is adequate.","title":"Produce"},{"location":"1st%20Session/03%20FAIR-by-Design%20Methodology/FAIR-by-Design_content/#publish","text":"A satisfactory completion of the internal QA leads to the publication steps.

Don't forget to QA the Learning Management System (LMS) The reviewer should play the role of a new learner in the LMS and check everything from the learner perspective. Go through the QA checklists In Skills4EOSC T2.4 has developed a number of QA checklists that you and your external reviewer need to go through so that you can ensure high-quality learning materials (see S\u00e1nchez et al. 2023 ).

Accessible : The materials are available to users under clear conditions, often through open access platforms. This means ensuring that the resources can be accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions or licenses, without unnecessary barriers like paywalls or restrictive access conditions. Interoperable : Learning materials are designed to be compatible with various systems and tools. This involves using standardized formats, protocols, and vocabularies that enable the integration and use of the materials across different platforms, enhancing the ability to mix, match, and repurpose content.

To achieve this, not only the learning objectives, but all content, activities, assignments and assessments must be learner-centered. Learners perform best when they are engaged in authentic activities, collaborate with peers to share and deepen their understanding, and apply their existing skills to different contexts and new problems. Rich learning experiences can be supported by inquiry-based learning structures, such as projects and performance tasks thoughtfully interwoven direct instruction opportunities to practice and apply learning It is important that learners are given meaningful tasks that build on their prior knowledge together with a safe positive environment in which they can receive timely and helpful feedback. Units should be well structured so as to reduce the unnecessary cognitive load, and based on multiple modalities and tools for accessing information and expressing learning to support different types of learners. Learning modalities refer to the different ways individuals process and retain information. These modalities highlight the diverse preferences and strengths people have when it comes to learning. The most commonly recognized learning modalities include: Visual Learners who prefer visual modalities understand and remember information better when it is presented in a visual format, such as diagrams, charts, graphs, and images. They benefit from seeing concepts and ideas. Auditory Auditory learners process information most effectively when it is heard. They learn well through lectures, discussions, podcasts, and verbal instructions. Reading/Writing These learners prefer interacting with text-based information. They excel in reading and writing tasks, such as taking notes, reading books, and writing essays or reports. Kinesthetic Kinesthetic learners are hands-on learners who grasp concepts best through physical activity and movement. They benefit from experiments, role-playing, and using objects or tools. Some theories and frameworks expand on learning modalities, recognizing that people often use a combination of these modalities rather than relying on a single one. Understanding and catering to different learning modalities can enhance teaching strategies and improve learning outcomes by providing varied methods of instruction that align with learners\u2019 preferences. Adding multimedia to the learning content Incorporating multimedia into learning content is directly related to learning modalities because it allows educators to address and engage different types of learners more effectively. Multimedia aligns with various learning modalities: Visual Learners: Multimedia can include videos, infographics, animations, and diagrams that visually represent concepts. This appeals to visual learners by providing clear and engaging ways to understand and remember information. Auditory Learners: By adding audio elements such as narrations, podcasts, or sound effects, multimedia caters to auditory learners who benefit from hearing information. This can include explanations, discussions, or even background music that reinforces the learning material. Reading/Writing Learners: Multimedia can integrate text-based elements, such as subtitles, captions, or interactive reading materials, which appeal to learners who prefer to read and write. Hyperlinks to additional reading, digital flashcards, or interactive eBooks also support this modality. Kinesthetic Learners: Interactive multimedia, such as simulations, virtual labs, or drag-and-drop activities, allows kinesthetic learners to engage with the content through physical interaction. This hands-on approach helps them better grasp and retain the material. By integrating multimedia, educators can create a richer, more inclusive learning environment that accommodates different learning preferences. It also helps to reinforce concepts through multiple channels, increasing the likelihood that learners will understand and retain the material. Adding multimedia to MD content While Markdown itself is quite simple, it can be enhanced with multimedia by incorporating various elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content. Different types of multimedia can be added to Markdown content by: Images To add images, use the following syntax: ![Alt text](image-url) such as ![A beautiful sunset](https://example.com/sunset.jpg) or if it is a local file ![Alt text](./path/to/image.jpg) Images in MD One of the most important things to remember is that the \"alt text\" is alternative text for the image that is used for accessibility purposes. It will be read by a screen reader that helps learners with visual impairments. Icons add visual interest and can help convey meaning quickly. While Markdown itself doesn\u2019t support icons natively, you can use HTML or rely on Markdown extensions or themes that support icons. Example <i class=\"fas fa-info-circle\"></i> This is an informational icon. Videos While Markdown doesn\u2019t natively support embedding videos, you can use HTML to embed videos from platforms like YouTube or use a link to direct users to the video. Using HTML (embedded video): <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Using a link (linked video): [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) Videos in MD As in the examples, it is best practice to put the video on a video streaming provider and then link or embed it. This helps keep the repo lean as video files are quite big, plus it allows you to use some advanced features such as auto captioning, chapters, playlists, etc. GIFs Another option is to use embedded GIFs as short videos. In this case it is as if you are adding an image ![Funny cat](https://example.com/funny-cat.gif) Audio To include audio, you can also use HTML: <audio controls> <source src=\"audio-file-url.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> for an example Your browser does not support the audio element. Accessible multimedia Provide transcripts and captions for audio and video content to make them accessible to all users. Interactive elements For more complex interactive elements, one might use HTML or specialized tools that support enhanced Markdown (like Jupyter notebooks or MkDocs): Interactive Maps, Charts, or Widgets: You can embed these by using <iframe> or specific Markdown extensions supported by your platform. Example (Embedded Map using HTML) <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18...\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe> Slideshows If you need to add a slideshow, you might use Markdown libraries such as Reveal.js that convert Markdown into presentation slides. Linking to Files For documents, PDFs, or other files: [Download the PDF](https://example.com/document.pdf) Markdown Extensions Some Markdown processors support extended syntax for including multimedia, such as MathJax for equations or Mermaid for diagrams. See the example in the previous module where the structure is presented using Mermaid. Admonitions are special call-out boxes that highlight important information or warnings. They help users quickly identify key points or notes. Use Admonitions to Highlight Key Information. Code blocks can also be used to provide source code examples to learners. Integrating Jupyter Notebooks with MkDocs can provide a powerful way to combine interactive code, data analysis, and documentation. This is particularly useful for projects that involve both technical explanations and live code examples. To mix MD with Jupyter Notebooks you can: Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown or HTML Jupyter Notebooks can be converted to Markdown or HTML, which can then be included in your MkDocs site. Use nbviewer or GitHub Gists for Live Notebooks services like nbviewer or GitHub Gists to embed live notebooks, such as [View Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/username/repository/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) Use jupyter-book for a Comprehensive Solution consider using jupyter-book, which is designed to work with Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown to create interactive books. also, the jupyter-mkdocs plugin enables you to run Jupyter Notebooks directly within MkDocs. Final Tips Maintain a Consistent Style : Use consistent image sizes, captions, and positioning throughout your content. Test Compatibility : Ensure that the multimedia elements work in the Markdown processor or platform you\u2019re using. Responsive Design : Ensure that your multimedia content is responsive, especially when using HTML, so that it looks good on different screen sizes. Provide Download Links for Media : Some users might prefer or need to download media files instead of viewing them directly in the browser. Documentation : Ensure that you provide clear documentation and context for users interacting with the Jupyter notebooks. DON'T Don\u2019t Overload Pages with Too Much Multimedia Why: Excessive multimedia can overwhelm users, slow down page loading, and distract from the core content. Tip: Use multimedia sparingly and only when it adds value to the content. Don\u2019t Use Low-Quality Media Why: Poor-quality images, videos, or audio can reduce the credibility and professionalism of your content. Tip: Always use high-resolution images and clear audio/video files. Don\u2019t Forget to Test Media Content Why: Media might not display or function as expected across different browsers or devices. Tip: Always test embedded media on multiple platforms before publishing. Don\u2019t Ignore Accessibility Why: Multimedia content should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Tip: Use alt text, provide transcripts for videos, and ensure that interactive elements are keyboard-navigable. Don\u2019t Link to Unreliable External Sources Why: Linking to external media that may be removed or blocked can result in broken links or missing content. Tip: Host essential media content yourself or ensure that external links are stable. Don\u2019t Use Auto-Playing Media Why: Auto-playing videos or audio can be intrusive and may disrupt the user\u2019s experience. Tip: Always allow users to control when media plays. Don\u2019t Neglect to Credit Sources Why: Failing to attribute media to its original creator can lead to copyright issues and diminish the trustworthiness of your content. Tip: Always include proper citations or credits when using third-party media. Don\u2019t Rely Solely on Multimedia Why: Some users may prefer or require text-based content, so always include a textual explanation or description of your multimedia. Tip: Pair videos with summaries, and images with descriptive captions. This approach helps create rich, multimedia-enhanced learning content that can cater to different learning modalities, making your materials more engaging and effective. Accessibility All developed learning content should be accessible to a wide range of learners with different needs from a variety of backgrounds, abilities and learning styles. To ensure this the developed content needs to be checked so that access is optimised and all unnecessary barriers are removed making it inclusive and easier to engage with by all learners including people with disabilities. Accessible educational materials (AEM) are defined as educational materials that are designed or later enhanced in such a way that it makes them usable across the widest range of learner variability. For digital learning materials and technologies this means that they are accessible if they can be easily used by anyone, including people with disabilities. Accessible digital learning materials need to be designed so that they can be directly used without assistive technology or made usable with assistive technology. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for accessible materials: simple text structure helps learners with a variety of learning needs, including learners for whom the language used is not their native language simple navigation through the materials should help access the content from mobile devices, as well as learners with low vision adding captions to videos helps learners with hearing impairment as well as learners that have low prior knowledge on the subject and key terminology. General guidelines for development of accessible materials Most of the techniques used for development of accessible learning materials are based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) that focuses on the design of learning materials that are aimed to be inclusive of as many learners as possible. This approach, combined with the assistive and accessible technologies, can ensure that every learner has access to the same materials. UDL is based on three fundamental principles: Multiple means of representation learning content should be presented in different ways and formats Multiple means of action and expression several options for action and expression should support the demonstration of acquired knowledge Multiple means of engagement learners differ in what engages and motivates them so multiple options should be provided The following are some general tips and guidelines that should help develop accessible learning content: Present the information in multiple ways and formats This helps support various learning styles and provides alternatives for different impairments. Use simple language The materials should be accessible for the learners' varying levels of access, background, and ability. An option is to provide additional resources to support learners that have comprehension difficulties. Use headings Assistive technologies differentiate the structural elements in the text (body text and different levels of headings). These help screen readers process the text correctly. Use table of content Helps learners navigate to the required information easily. Provide alternative text for images The alternative text is read by the screen reader instead of the image. Decorative images should be marked as decorative so that the screen reader can skip them. Use equation editors for math expressions This format helps screen readers understand the content. Use a high contrast color palette High contrast supports learners with vision impairments. Don't use color as the only way to convey information Provide other alternative means for color blind learners. Use descriptive links Links to other documents should explain where the link is taking the learner. Use tables only when required If a table is truly the best way to convey the information and not just a layout trick, then use column and row headers to describe the content. Provide closed captions and transcripts Helps make the information in the video accessible to the vision impaired. Alternative text tips and tricks For tip on how to write alternative text for images study the Alternative text guide by WebAIM . The key takeaways in the guide include: alternative text should be accurate and equivalent in representing content and function alternative text should be succinct alternative text should not be redundant alternative text should not include phrases such as \"image of ...\" or \"graphic of ...\" Decorative images should have blank alternative text. A decorative image is an image that does not present important content is used for layout or non-informative purposes does not have a function (e.g. is not a link) Summary To create an engaging and inclusive learning experience, it\u2019s essential to understand and integrate various learning modalities, incorporate multimedia effectively, and ensure accessibility. Learning modalities include visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and read/write styles, each catering to different ways individuals process information. By incorporating multimedia elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content, educators can address diverse learning preferences and enrich the educational experience. This not only helps in accommodating various learning styles but also makes the content more engaging and dynamic. Ensuring accessibility is crucial in making learning resources usable for all individuals, including those with disabilities. This involves using descriptive alt text for images, providing transcripts and captions for audio and video content, and ensuring high color contrast and responsive design. Additionally, interactive elements should be navigable via keyboard, and semantic HTML should be employed to aid screen readers in interpreting content. By following these best practices, educational content becomes more inclusive, allowing all learners to access and benefit from the material effectively.

See the example in the previous module where the structure is presented using Mermaid. Admonitions are special call-out boxes that highlight important information or warnings. They help users quickly identify key points or notes. Use Admonitions to Highlight Key Information. Code blocks can also be used to provide source code examples to learners. Integrating Jupyter Notebooks with MkDocs can provide a powerful way to combine interactive code, data analysis, and documentation. This is particularly useful for projects that involve both technical explanations and live code examples. To mix MD with Jupyter Notebooks you can: Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown or HTML Jupyter Notebooks can be converted to Markdown or HTML, which can then be included in your MkDocs site. Use nbviewer or GitHub Gists for Live Notebooks services like nbviewer or GitHub Gists to embed live notebooks, such as [View Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/username/repository/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) Use jupyter-book for a Comprehensive Solution consider using jupyter-book, which is designed to work with Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown to create interactive books. also, the jupyter-mkdocs plugin enables you to run Jupyter Notebooks directly within MkDocs. Final Tips Maintain a Consistent Style : Use consistent image sizes, captions, and positioning throughout your content. Test Compatibility : Ensure that the multimedia elements work in the Markdown processor or platform you\u2019re using. Responsive Design : Ensure that your multimedia content is responsive, especially when using HTML, so that it looks good on different screen sizes.

Tip: Use multimedia sparingly and only when it adds value to the content. Don\u2019t Use Low-Quality Media Why: Poor-quality images, videos, or audio can reduce the credibility and professionalism of your content. Tip: Always use high-resolution images and clear audio/video files. Don\u2019t Forget to Test Media Content Why: Media might not display or function as expected across different browsers or devices. Tip: Always test embedded media on multiple platforms before publishing. Don\u2019t Ignore Accessibility Why: Multimedia content should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Tip: Use alt text, provide transcripts for videos, and ensure that interactive elements are keyboard-navigable. Don\u2019t Link to Unreliable External Sources Why: Linking to external media that may be removed or blocked can result in broken links or missing content. Tip: Host essential media content yourself or ensure that external links are stable. Don\u2019t Use Auto-Playing Media Why: Auto-playing videos or audio can be intrusive and may disrupt the user\u2019s experience. Tip: Always allow users to control when media plays. Don\u2019t Neglect to Credit Sources Why: Failing to attribute media to its original creator can lead to copyright issues and diminish the trustworthiness of your content. Tip: Always include proper citations or credits when using third-party media. Don\u2019t Rely Solely on Multimedia Why: Some users may prefer or require text-based content, so always include a textual explanation or description of your multimedia.

To ensure this the developed content needs to be checked so that access is optimised and all unnecessary barriers are removed making it inclusive and easier to engage with by all learners including people with disabilities. Accessible educational materials (AEM) are defined as educational materials that are designed or later enhanced in such a way that it makes them usable across the widest range of learner variability. For digital learning materials and technologies this means that they are accessible if they can be easily used by anyone, including people with disabilities. Accessible digital learning materials need to be designed so that they can be directly used without assistive technology or made usable with assistive technology. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for accessible materials: simple text structure helps learners with a variety of learning needs, including learners for whom the language used is not their native language simple navigation through the materials should help access the content from mobile devices, as well as learners with low vision adding captions to videos helps learners with hearing impairment as well as learners that have low prior knowledge on the subject and key terminology.","title":"Accessibility"},{"location":"1st%20Session/06%20Rich%20learning%20exp/Rich%20learning%20experience/#general-guidelines-for-development-of-accessible-materials","text":"Most of the techniques used for development of accessible learning materials are based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) that focuses on the design of learning materials that are aimed to be inclusive of as many learners as possible. This approach, combined with the assistive and accessible technologies, can ensure that every learner has access to the same materials. UDL is based on three fundamental principles: Multiple means of representation learning content should be presented in different ways and formats Multiple means of action and expression several options for action and expression should support the demonstration of acquired knowledge Multiple means of engagement learners differ in what engages and motivates them so multiple options should be provided The following are some general tips and guidelines that should help develop accessible learning content: Present the information in multiple ways and formats This helps support various learning styles and provides alternatives for different impairments. Use simple language The materials should be accessible for the learners' varying levels of access, background, and ability. An option is to provide additional resources to support learners that have comprehension difficulties. Use headings Assistive technologies differentiate the structural elements in the text (body text and different levels of headings). These help screen readers process the text correctly. Use table of content Helps learners navigate to the required information easily. Provide alternative text for images The alternative text is read by the screen reader instead of the image. Decorative images should be marked as decorative so that the screen reader can skip them. Use equation editors for math expressions This format helps screen readers understand the content. Use a high contrast color palette High contrast supports learners with vision impairments. Don't use color as the only way to convey information Provide other alternative means for color blind learners. Use descriptive links Links to other documents should explain where the link is taking the learner. Use tables only when required If a table is truly the best way to convey the information and not just a layout trick, then use column and row headers to describe the content. Provide closed captions and transcripts Helps make the information in the video accessible to the vision impaired.","title":"General guidelines for development of accessible materials"},{"location":"1st%20Session/06%20Rich%20learning%20exp/Rich%20learning%20experience/#alternative-text-tips-and-tricks","text":"For tip on how to write alternative text for images study the Alternative text guide by WebAIM .

Learning modalities include visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and read/write styles, each catering to different ways individuals process information. By incorporating multimedia elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content, educators can address diverse learning preferences and enrich the educational experience. This not only helps in accommodating various learning styles but also makes the content more engaging and dynamic. Ensuring accessibility is crucial in making learning resources usable for all individuals, including those with disabilities. This involves using descriptive alt text for images, providing transcripts and captions for audio and video content, and ensuring high color contrast and responsive design. Additionally, interactive elements should be navigable via keyboard, and semantic HTML should be employed to aid screen readers in interpreting content. By following these best practices, educational content becomes more inclusive, allowing all learners to access and benefit from the material effectively.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"1st%20Session/06%20Rich%20learning%20exp/Rich%20learning%20experience/#suggested-reading","text":"Advanced editing in MD with multimedia More about accessibility and standards for accessibility","title":"Suggested Reading"},{"location":"1st%20Session/07%20Citing%20and%20attribution/Citing%20and%20attribution/","tags":["Citing","Attribution"],"text":"Citing and Attribution Slides Download the slides here Introduction Summary Summary Suggested Reading Skills4EOSC FAIR-by-Design Methodology for Learning Materials Development","title":"Citing and attribution"},{"location":"1st%20Session/07%20Citing%20and%20attribution/Citing%20and%20attribution/#citing-and-attribution","text":"","title":"Citing and Attribution"},{"location":"1st%20Session/07%20Citing%20and%20attribution/Citing%20and%20attribution/#slides","text":"Download the slides here","title":"Slides"},{"location":"1st%20Session/07%20Citing%20and%20attribution/Citing%20and%20attribution/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1st%20Session/07%20Citing%20and%20attribution/Citing%20and%20attribution/#summary","text":"Summary","title":"Summary"},{"location":"1st%20Session/07%20Citing%20and%20attribution/Citing%20and%20attribution/#suggested-reading","text":"Skills4EOSC FAIR-by-Design Methodology for Learning Materials Development","title":"Suggested Reading"},{"location":"2nd%20Session/02%20Version%20control/Session%201%20Recap/","tags":["CLARIN"],"text":"Slides (new) Download the slides regarding the FAIR-by-Design Methodology here Introduction Summary Suggested Reading Skills4EOSC FAIR-by-Design Methodology for Learning Materials Development","title":"About CLARIN"},{"location":"2nd%20Session/02%20Version%20control/Session%201%20Recap/#slides-new","text":"Download the slides regarding the FAIR-by-Design Methodology here","title":"Slides (new)"},{"location":"2nd%20Session/02%20Version%20control/Session%201%20Recap/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"2nd%20Session/02%20Version%20control/Session%201%20Recap/#summary","text":"","title":"Summary"},{"location":"2nd%20Session/02%20Version%20control/Session%201%20Recap/#suggested-reading","text":"Skills4EOSC FAIR-by-Design Methodology for Learning Materials Development","title":"Suggested Reading"}]}
