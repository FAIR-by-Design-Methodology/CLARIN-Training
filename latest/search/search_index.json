It is available for all popular platforms either as a first-party command line utility or through third-party graphical user interface (GUI) clients. Git uses the concept of repositories which can granularly manage the versions of all objects placed within it. File changes are committed to a repository and each commit is automatically associated a unique and random identifier. In addition to this identifier, each commit is also described by its author, commit title and commit description. A single Git repository can be used by multiple users, each contributing and committing their changes. To facilitate remote collaboration, a Git repository can be shared publicly or privately. Git hosting services, such as GitHub and GitLab offer this functionality today for free. While Git can also be used independently from such hosting services, either completely locally and offline or by devising a custom synchronization workflow with third parties, in reality this is rarely the case. </p> <p>Git repositories can also be forked, meaning that their current state is copied to a brand new repository, preserving all history. The user who has initiated the fork can then make any desired changes directly to their own fork of the repository. If desired, such changes can optionally be reconciled and added to the original repository from which the fork was created, provided that they are accepted by the original owner. This is possible due to the fact that the repositories will have a shared history at least up until the point when the fork was made. In case their files have diverged (e.g., both the original and forked repository contain changes to the same files), and if these changes are conflicting (e.g., changes to the same part of a given document), Git will mark these changes and leave it up to the owner of the repository to decide how to proceed, and what version to accept. </p> <p>Below is a list of common Git related terminology which will be useful for the remaining of the training:</p> <ul> <li>Git repository \u2013 a collaborative space where files can be versioned</li> <li>Git commit \u2013 a granular change of a single or multiple files in the repository, identified by a random unique identifier, the committer's name, email address, short commit title and an optional longer commit description. A commit can contain file additions, modifications, removal, or relocation to a different directory.</li> <li>Git clone \u2013 an action to download locally an existing Git repository. A repository hosted on a public Git hosting service such as GitHub can be cloned by anyone (assuming it is public) on their local machines. Once downloaded, users can explore the repository and optionally send their contributed changes upstream, if they have been assigned the necessary permissions.</li> <li>Git fork \u2013 a 1:1 copy of an existing Git repository. A fork of an existing repository results with the creation of a brand new repository which will have a shared history with the original one up until the fork was made. The owner of the forked repository will be the user who initiated the fork. The original owner of the repository does not have any right in the forked repository by default. </li> <li>Pull request/Merge request \u2013 when changes are made to a forked repository, they can be contributed back to the original repository by creating a merge request or a pull request (the terms are synonyms, depending on the platform either one can be used). With this approach a privileged user from the original repository from which the fork was initiated can review the changes and decide whether to accept them, modify them, or outright reject them. Forks can exist independently of the original repository forever.</li> </ul>","tags":["Version control"]},{"location":"2nd%20Session/02%20Version%20control/Version%20control/#filling-out-release_notesmd","title":"Filling out\u00a0RELEASE_NOTES.md","text":"<ol> <li>Open the\u00a0RELEASE_NOTES.md`\u00a0file by clicking on its name from the left-hand directory tree.</li> <li>The file uses a special Markdown syntax which allows its contents to be shown as collapsed on the syllabus home page, thus preserving space.\u00a0</li> <li>For the initial\u00a0release, alter the text below the\u00a0<code>1.0.0</code>\u00a0heading and make sure to also update the date of the\u00a0release\u00a0in the heading itself.</li> <li>For all subsequent\u00a0releases, add a new level two heading using two hash symbols on a new line, (<code>##</code>) just below\u00a0<code>&lt;summary&gt;Release\u00a0Notes &lt;summary&gt;</code>.

The picture below provides a visual example of how to correctly add a new author.</p> <p></p> <p>The newly added author (an imaginary John Doe) should have the same indentation (number of spaces at the beginning of the line) as the first author which is given as an example in the template. Inconsistent number of spaces will make the CITATION.cff file invalid. Additionally, we denote that we are adding information about a new author by prefixing the first property (in this case <code>family-names</code>) with a <code>-</code> character.</p> </li> <li> <p>Note that any other fields also present in the <code>CITATION.cff</code> file such as: <code>version</code>, <code>doi</code>, <code>date-released</code> should not be manually edited. They will be updated automatically when publishing the repository to Zenodo.</p> </li> <li> <p>After having done the necessary updates to the fields, you can validate the structure of the <code>CITATION.cff</code> file using the free online utility which is available on citation-file-format.github.io.</p> <ul> <li>Paste the content into the text field</li> <li>Press the <code>PARSE</code> button</li> <li> <p>Ignore any warnings about \"extra\" fields.

This is an optional field that can be left blank, in which case no profile information will be provided. More information is available on the Signposting docs page.</li> <li><code>signposting_gitbook_url</code> - an optional parameter that is commented by default.
