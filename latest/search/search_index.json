This methodology ensures that learning materials, such as course content, training modules, and educational resources, are not only well-structured and high-quality but also meet specific criteria that make them easier to discover, use, and adapt within the Open Science ecosystem. In this way the methodology guarantees that the produced materials will be FAIR not just from the point of view of the learners, but also other designers and trainers that would like to reuse and adapt the materials for their own purposes. FAIR-by-Design Methodology Stages The FAIR-by-Design Methodology is created around the popular backward instructional design process that is used to develop high-quality learner-centric materials. We have taken the steps of the backward instruction design process and added additional considerations to ensure that the process will be aimed towards the design of FAIR learning content from both the perspective of the learners and the perspective of the instructional designers and trainers. The methodology is broken down into a number of stages that are connected in a feedback loop thus enabling continuous improvement: Prepare In the Prepare stage the instructional designers need to expand their skillset so that they can practically implement the FAIR principles . This means that in addition to the traditional instructional design skills, they should also be able to work with PIDs, repositories and catalogues, use a corresponding metadata schema, choose a license, and know how to acknowledge reused work with attribution. One of the important tasks in this stage is to familiarize with the RDA minimal metadata schema for learning resources as this is the basis for the description of the FAIR learning materials. This is when the backward learning process begins: Step 1 : What are your desired effects, i.e. learning outcomes? Step 2 : How are you going to assess the learners' achievements? Step 3 : How should you structure the material to reach them? This is the initial stage of the learning materials development process and thus it is important that in this stage the designer clearly defines the purpose of the learning materials, the target audience and the learning objectives while taking into consideration any prerequisites. Purpose When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes? Target Audience Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context? Prerequisites What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process? Scope Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course? Learning Objectives What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process? Objectives should be S pecific, M easurable, A ttainable, R elevant and T ime-bound. Use Blooms Taxonomy: Formulate the objectives as actionable verb + observable knowledge, skill, attitude, behavior or ability. Discover Once the vision of what needs to be created is clear, the next step is to discover any existing learning materials that can be reused or simply serve as inspiration. For these purposes the designer needs to search different types of repositories that might host similar learning materials including OER repositories, learning platforms, general repositories and catalogues, as well as multimedia repositories that can provide sources of audio/visual props that are essential in multi-modal learning. OER DOAB MERLOT OASIS OER Commons OERTX CORA GALILEO FORRT EOSC_ EOSC Training catalogue on the EOSC Marketplace Most EOSC projects have their own training catalogues and/or platforms... General Creative Commons Search - content provided under a CC license Zenodo - a multi-disciplinary open repository OSF - a free, open research platform Design At this stage the designer has a clear idea of what is needed and what already exists. The next step is to sketch a conceptual map of the learning materials that will help crystalize the ideas and prepare the syllabus for the learning materials. The syllabus is then used as a high-level blueprint for the development of the learning materials. In the design stage the overall structure of the learning materials is defined identifying all modules and learning units necessary together with the information on what can be reused and what needs to be designed from scratch. Careful attention should be put on license compatibility during this work. Tip Create an intuitive logical organisation of all learning materials. Tip The goal is for other people to easily reuse a single item (plan, activity, unit, assessment, ...). Tip Use a hierarchical structure to combine learning units into larger compositions. Upon completing the structure, each learning unit needs to be designed using a modeling technique such as the Hunter's model. The design stage should also take into account the need for development of a facilitation guide that explains in details how to prepare and put the training into practice, as well as a feedback form that should be used to gather feedback after the learning process has finished Produce When the design is complete, it is time to move to the produce stage and choose the tools and file formats necessary to develop all of the content. Care must be taken that the chosen file formats are open so that reusability is supported, and it is recommended that a collaborative, versioning system is used to keep track of all contributions and changes. It is important to consider both the editable files that can be reused by trainers and the final file formats intended for learners. Collaborative environment for team work Choose an environment for producing the learning material that will enable multiple people to work on the same material at one. Two examples are workplace or GitHub (find out more here ). Replicate the folder tree in the environment and start using the provided templates to generate the content. Granular versioning for easy rollback Versioning helps you maintain control over your changes. If the collaborative environment does not provide versioning and history retention then keep a history of the files by adopting a naming convention such as combining the file name with an increasing version number. Open file formats to foster reuse For other people to reuse your materials they should be made available using open file formats (docx, pptx, pdf, md, html, etc.). If you use close file formats then you MUST clearly state the tools that have been used for development in your README file. Multimodal content to reach all audience Don't forget to include different types of multimedia to provide support for different learning modalities: read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic. Two file sets: editable + final Always work with and keep a history of your editable files. These are what matters for you and other instructors. The second set of final files should be obtained from the editable when needed (before distributing them to the learners). The final files should be kept on the learning platform only. In this way you don't need to worry about keeping the versions in sync. Don't forget to support co-creation Truly FAIR learning materials should enable co-creation with external parties. If you don't use a collaborative environment that supports this from the start (such as GitHub), then think how are you going to enable this in the future and how are you going to deal with versioning then. One of the most important aspects of the produce stage is accessibility of the developed learning materials . Accessibility standards should be followed so as to maximize the audience for the learning materials. During this stage the designers must not forget to add the human-readable and machine-readable metadata in the developed content as well as to develop the content of all facilitation documents such as the guide, activities description, lesson plans, etc. The final step in the produce stage is to perform an internal Quality Assessment that will check that all elements are present and that the content is adequate. Publish A satisfactory completion of the internal QA leads to the publication steps. Before the actual publication, very important final touches need to be done including activities such as the definition of the content of accompanying files : license, readme, citation, code of conduct and alike. Accompanying files Define the overall license, provide description, instructions on how to cite your materials, define the code of conduct for a co-creation environment, etc. Put into repository Publish the editable package in an appropriate FAIR repository. This record is primarily intended for reuse by other designers and trainers. Provide to learners Provide the final non-editable versions to the learners on a learning platform of your choice. Verify The final steps in the methodology is to perform another QA round, this time focusing on external QA . At this stage the overall level of FAIRness of the learning materials needs to be checked and external experts should be used to provide unbiased feedback regarding the quality of the produced materials. A fresh set of eyes Have someone who has not participated in the development of the learning materials review the final work. This will guarantee a review free of cognitive bias. Don't forget to QA the Learning Management System (LMS) The reviewer should play the role of a new learner in the LMS and check everything from the learner perspective. Go through the QA checklists In Skills4EOSC T2.4 has developed a number of QA checklists that you and your external reviewer need to go through so that you can ensure high-quality learning materials (see S\u00e1nchez et al. 2023 ). This stage also focuses on setting up different mechanism for gathering feedback so that the learning materials can be further improved. In this way it fosters the co-creation process that empowers learners and other designers and trainers to actively participate in the development. Continuous Improvement The gathered internal and external feedback should be used as input for the development of a new version of the learning materials. Upon the identification of potential improvements that should be implemented, the development process circles back to the first stage aiming to publish a new improved version of the learning materials. Gather Gather feedback from all available internal & external sources. Analyse Analyse the gathered information in a structured way. Create a list of potential improvements with impact level (high, moderate, low). Improve Select items from the list that will be part of a new version. Choose items that make sense to be in the same new release. Repeat Start a new cycle of the FAIR-by-Design methodology that will implement the selected items. After the Verify stage, you will reenter continuous improvement with newly gathered information.... Summary The FAIR-by-Design methodology proposes six stages that aim to ensure that the end result will be FAIR Learning Materials that are: Findable : Learning materials are indexed in a way that makes them easily discoverable by both humans and machines. This typically involves assigning persistent identifiers, such as DOIs, and providing rich metadata that includes detailed descriptions, keywords, and other information that facilitates search and discovery. Accessible : The materials are available to users under clear conditions, often through open access platforms. This means ensuring that the resources can be accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions or licenses, without unnecessary barriers like paywalls or restrictive access conditions. Interoperable : Learning materials are designed to be compatible with various systems and tools. This involves using standardized formats, protocols, and vocabularies that enable the integration and use of the materials across different platforms, enhancing the ability to mix, match, and repurpose content. Reusable : The resources are created with reuse in mind, allowing others to easily adapt or repurpose them for different contexts. This requires clear licensing, proper documentation, and a modular design that facilitates modification and customization.

This means that in addition to the traditional instructional design skills, they should also be able to work with PIDs, repositories and catalogues, use a corresponding metadata schema, choose a license, and know how to acknowledge reused work with attribution. One of the important tasks in this stage is to familiarize with the RDA minimal metadata schema for learning resources as this is the basis for the description of the FAIR learning materials. This is when the backward learning process begins: Step 1 : What are your desired effects, i.e. learning outcomes? Step 2 : How are you going to assess the learners' achievements? Step 3 : How should you structure the material to reach them? This is the initial stage of the learning materials development process and thus it is important that in this stage the designer clearly defines the purpose of the learning materials, the target audience and the learning objectives while taking into consideration any prerequisites. Purpose When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes? Target Audience Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context? Prerequisites What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process? Scope Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course? Learning Objectives What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process? Objectives should be S pecific, M easurable, A ttainable, R elevant and T ime-bound.

In the design stage the overall structure of the learning materials is defined identifying all modules and learning units necessary together with the information on what can be reused and what needs to be designed from scratch. Careful attention should be put on license compatibility during this work. Tip Create an intuitive logical organisation of all learning materials. Tip The goal is for other people to easily reuse a single item (plan, activity, unit, assessment, ...). Tip Use a hierarchical structure to combine learning units into larger compositions. Upon completing the structure, each learning unit needs to be designed using a modeling technique such as the Hunter's model.

Care must be taken that the chosen file formats are open so that reusability is supported, and it is recommended that a collaborative, versioning system is used to keep track of all contributions and changes. It is important to consider both the editable files that can be reused by trainers and the final file formats intended for learners. Collaborative environment for team work Choose an environment for producing the learning material that will enable multiple people to work on the same material at one. Two examples are workplace or GitHub (find out more here ). Replicate the folder tree in the environment and start using the provided templates to generate the content. Granular versioning for easy rollback Versioning helps you maintain control over your changes. If the collaborative environment does not provide versioning and history retention then keep a history of the files by adopting a naming convention such as combining the file name with an increasing version number. Open file formats to foster reuse For other people to reuse your materials they should be made available using open file formats (docx, pptx, pdf, md, html, etc.). If you use close file formats then you MUST clearly state the tools that have been used for development in your README file. Multimodal content to reach all audience Don't forget to include different types of multimedia to provide support for different learning modalities: read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic. Two file sets: editable + final Always work with and keep a history of your editable files. These are what matters for you and other instructors. The second set of final files should be obtained from the editable when needed (before distributing them to the learners). The final files should be kept on the learning platform only. In this way you don't need to worry about keeping the versions in sync. Don't forget to support co-creation Truly FAIR learning materials should enable co-creation with external parties. If you don't use a collaborative environment that supports this from the start (such as GitHub), then think how are you going to enable this in the future and how are you going to deal with versioning then. One of the most important aspects of the produce stage is accessibility of the developed learning materials . Accessibility standards should be followed so as to maximize the audience for the learning materials. During this stage the designers must not forget to add the human-readable and machine-readable metadata in the developed content as well as to develop the content of all facilitation documents such as the guide, activities description, lesson plans, etc. The final step in the produce stage is to perform an internal Quality Assessment that will check that all elements are present and that the content is adequate.","title":"Produce"},{"location":"1st%20Session/03%20FAIR-by-Design%20Methodology/FAIR-by-Design_content/#publish","text":"A satisfactory completion of the internal QA leads to the publication steps.

These elements need to be standardized so that they are useful when used in practice. This is done by defining a metadata schema that describes the structure of the metadata elements. The metadata schema defines the standards for describing the metadata elements. The metadata schema for learning resources that also defines the type of each element, the allowed values, and constraints is available on the RDA website: RDA Minimal Metadata for Learning Resources Professional and Informal Education Examples Controlled Vocabularies Some of the fields in the proposed RDA metadata schema are based on fixed or suggested controlled vocabularies (CV). The use of controlled vocabularies is to help humans and machines categorize the information while helping to reduce duplication and errors. In essence, controlled vocabularies should be used for any metadata elements with predefined value(s), where in the vocabulary is presented as a list of prescribed items.

Note that in many cases controlled vocabularies are suggested, but at this stage they are not strictly defined. Later on during this training, you will learn how and where to define the metadata for your learning resources. Backward instructional design process The backward design first focuses on the learning outcomes that one wants to achieve and then works backward to the topics that need to be covered in order to achieve the learning objectives. \" Backward design model \" from Muhlenberg College licensed under the CC BY-NC 4.0 . By following this process, the learner becomes the focal point of the training, making the developed learning materials learner-centric. Ideating a learning resource According to best practices for the instructional design process in the initial preparation phase (step 1) there should be a clear definition of the overarching aspects and considerations related to the learning materials that are going to be created. The aspects that need to be defined first are: Purpose of learning material when and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes Target Audience \u2013 the primary audience for the learning materials is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context Prerequisites what does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process it is suggested to use names and links to other learning materials if possible Overall Scope of the learning materials is it going to be a single learning object, or an aggregation of some sort such as a course Learning Objectives what competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process If possible, the choice of a delivery platform should be postponed to the design step as to ensure that the choice is compatible with the types of learning objects identified for potential reuse. Defining learning objectives Learning objectives should describe what new knowledge and skills will be obtained in a specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) way. The learning objectives are used to organize specific topics or individual learning activities so that the learner can most effectively achieve the overall learning outcome. To ensure standardization and wide understanding of the learning objective, it is best practice to define the learning objectives using a well-known taxonomy such as the Bloom\u2019s taxonomy . The Bloom's Taxonomy is a classification of the different objectives and skills that educators set for their students (learning outcomes). The cognitive domain categorizes the human learning process into 6 hierarchical levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. \" Bloom's Revised Taxonomy \" by Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching licensed under the terms of the CC-BY-2.0 . When defining learning objectives using the Bloom's taxonomy, correct verbs should be used for each objective based on the level the learners needs to achieve. For these purposes the example verbs provided in the image can be used. Bloom's taxonomy by Fractus Learning . (2023, July 10). In Wikipedia licensed under the terms of CC BY-SA 4.0 . This approach will significantly improve the findability of the produced resources, as well as the potential reuse of individual learning objects in different aggregations. The number of learning objectives depends on the aggregation level of the learning resource that is being developed. Syllabus Once you have identified your learning concepts, the next step is to sequence them into an instructional sequence (agenda). This instructional sequence will become your blueprint for the organisation of the learning materials and the definition of the syllabus. In essence the blueprint takes the input from the creative concept map and organizes it into a more formal outline. Formally, we call this learning materials outline syllabus. Each syllabus should provide information regarding a number of elements (including the ones defined in the step 1 of the backward instructional design): clear, descriptive title description of the purpose or goal target audience prerequisites duration learning objectives agenda (instructional sequence) resources and materials certification information Remember that: The syllabus can present a higher level sequence outline, that can be later broken down into smaller subtopics if necessary. The topics sequence should be defined so that the concepts introduced early help with the ones encountered later. The defined agenda should not be very rigid thus preventing changing the sequence of topics or adding or deleting topics at a later stage. The syllabus is sent to the learners and should provide them with all necessary information to help them decide if they want to follow the training related to the learning materials. Syllabus Elements Within this training we recommend the development of a training syllabus that consists of two groups of information: typical syllabus information additional information related to the RDA minimal metadata schema The following is a list of all required syllabus fields : Clear descriptive Title of the training Type (Course/Workshop/Webinar) Date/Time: when it will be offered (available from date if it is self-paced) Location - where it will be available physical location URL link to resources (and virtual room if online) should lead to the learning Skills4EOSC platform Training Description - what is the main goal/purpose of this training Target audience: target audience description Expertise Level / Skill Level: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced Primary Language: English Access Cost: N Prerequisites - if any Duration - total training duration Training objectives - list of specific training objectives Keywords - Keywords or tags used to describe the training Agenda: Training Schedule - Training Structure (time, topic) Resources and Materials - list with locations of available/required resources for the training Certification Information - if any Author(s) - Comma separated List of people involved in preparing the training (Name Surname) Trainer(s) - Comma separated list of people involved in delivering the training (Name Surname ORCID logo link) Contact information - how to reach out to training organizers License PID Accessibility Mission As syllabus is one of the required documents for the FAIR-by-Design learning materials, you must ensure that your syllabus contains all elements provided in this section. Only in this way you will ensure that your learning materials contain all necessary metadata information together with the traditional syllabus information that is provided.

This document incorporates all aspects that should lead to a high quality learning experience as it defines the plan on how to use teaching methods and the learning content together with activities to achieve the defined learning objectives. Note that an effective lesson plan for online trainees may not be the same to the one for traditional workshop settings. Formally, a unit plan refers to a detailed step-by-step guide for a trainer to understand what materials to give to students and how to provide them so students would accomplish their learning goals. There may be different detail levels of the learning unit plan: Detailed: a detailed plan that includes what will be the trainer step-by-step plan and learning activities. Semi-detailed: a semi-detailed plan is less complex and offers a general game plan of what will be covered in the unit. It is recommended that you follow the Hunter's model for developing a learning unit plan: Set the learning objectives These are lower level learning objectives for the particular learning unit. Combining all learning objectives from all units should lead to the high level learning objectives defined in the syllabus. Ensure these are clear and follow a logical order that is easy to understand and help identify meaningful concepts and ideas. Follow the Bloom's taxonomy again. Identify the needs of the target audience Make sure you are prepared to help learners along the way Plan your training material Create a list of all the resources. From stationary like a pen or paper to technology equipment like laptops, software, or gamified learning tools like apps or any website, all these can help you get the most out of what you intend to do. Present the outline of the unit - the Hook Throughout the training, the goal is to keep learners engaged. An outline can help them develop a context around the subject, letting them know what is coming next, and encourage them to relate to the learning materials at hand. Don\u2019t forget to draw relevant examples of events or develop creative activities that spark interest and attention. Instruct the lesson Follow the order and present the resources you need, but also make sure to involve the learners in this process. You may use as much multimedia as you want to facilitate engagement and give a wealth of examples learners can relate to easily \u2013 most important is to present the information in a meaningful way. Provide time to practice Once you finish your instruction, it\u2019s the learners\u2019 turn to take the lead. Ask them to show what they have learned through practice. For an example start with a guided practice \u2013 allowing learners to make sense of the information they have just received. Then you can follow up with a collaborative process \u2013 let them work in groups to explore main concepts. Finish with independent practice \u2013 giving each time to work on their own through an assignment. Wrap-up Do an overview of what has been discussed and what has been learned. Ask learners to tell you the key takeaways, identifying main ideas and conclusions. Give a preview of the next unit to prepare them. Evaluate Determine whether the learning objectives have been met, and ensure that learners understood what you taught through a small quiz, test, or exam. Reflection Did everything do as planned or something needs to be improved? Learning Unit Plan Development In a nutshell, the required information that you need to provide in your learning plan is: Unit Name Purpose of the unit Location Duration Number of attendees Learning objectives Plan including topic, duration, key points, teaching methods, activities and resources Assessment Certification Reflection Remember that although some parts of this information may seem repetitive with the overall syllabus, the plan is much more detailed and the repetition provides the much needed context for reuse. Method(s) When developing the plan you will need to think about the teaching methods that will be used during the training. One or more preferred teaching methods should be utilised during the training for maximum effect. Some typical teaching methods that can be employed are presented in the following image Image by edX from teach.com , \u00a9 2U Activity Analyse the Example Learning Plan that has been created for one of the learning units that are part of this training. Are you able to prepape a learning unit plan for the identified units in your Open Science training? Note that the development process is iterative. As you develop the content later on you might come back to the plan and make changes. Don't forget that larger changes might also affect the syllabus. Learning Content Once you have a plan, it is time to start developing the learning content. Remember to design the content so that it appeals learners with different modalities (verbal, audio, read/write, kinesthetic) including different multimedia. The learners notebook is the main learning content that you are aiming to introduce the learners to. The content of each learning unit notebook should include: brief introduction learning objectives target audience duration prerequisites learning tools content summary suggested reading Again, although some items may seem repetitive compared to the syllabus, bear in mind that this is done in order to improve reusability. In this way the learning unit can be reused as a stand alone package. Remember to add different types of media to the content, supporting an integrated multi-modal approach. For pure self-based learning the complete notebook should be enough to present all of the learning content in one place. However, for trainer led environments, usually a slide deck is also necessary so that the trainer can lead the trainees across the learning content and work with them through the activities. The slide deck should follow the stages of the HUNTER model : title slide introduction (trainers and trainees) Housekeeping information Learning Objectives Training Outline Training Topic information example guided activity Wrap up key takeaways final Q&A assessment information feedback gathering Activity details All activities that are planned to be performed with or by the learners as part of the learning unit plan should be described in enough details so that they can be executed by any trainer or facilitator no matter if they are part of the original instructional design team or not. They could be only tasked with training implementation, or they could be simply reusing the learning material. In addition, this additional documentation related to activity description can serve as a personal reminder long after the training has been completed and it allows for keeping notes on how the activity was implemented as well as any external community feedback. Based on the best practices, each activity should be described in a separate document that contains: activity name short description duration number of people it can be performed with goal materials instructions tips and tricks related sources comments This example of an activity description document related to one of the activities offered in this training can help you visualise the type of information that needs to be included for each activity. A set of well described and reusable activities can be found at the Session lab website . Another source of activities is 25 activities for making lecture-based training active . Assessment Thinking about how you can assess the learners obtained knowledge is part of step 2 of the backward instructional design process. Traditionally, there are many different types of assessments that can be performed, but the most typically used in professional training and certification is the quiz form. In general, quizzes can be used in a large variety of settings, providing opportunities for reflection, knowledge improvement with feedback or assessment. Although they can be setup as formative (after each learning unit) or summative (one exam quiz at the end), from the FAIR-by-design perspective, it is recommended that at least the questions that form the quiz are setup in a formative way, meaning each learning unit comes with a set of questions that are related to that particular learning unit. In this way, it is up to the instructor to setup the assessment: is it going to be multiple quizzes throughout or is it going to be one in the end. When designing the quiz questions one should go back to the Bloom's taxonomy introduced . This time however, you are interested in what type of quiz question can be used to assess the knowledge of a different level of the cognitive domain. This is presented in the table below. T/F MC MS LA SA FIB MAT ORD Create X Evaluate X X X X Analyze X X X Apply X X X X X Understand X X X X Remember X X X X X where T/F - True/False MC - multiple choice MS - multi-select LA - long answer SA - short answer FIB - fill in the blank MAT - Matching ORD - Ordering The easiest way to define the quiz questions in a reusable format is to use the GIFT quiz format that can then be imported in the Skills4EOSC learning platform (the other way around is also possible, export the questions created on the platform in GIFT for others to reuse). The provided Quiz GIFT Template contains examples of the different types of questions. Detailed instructions on how to write quiz questions in the GIFT format can be found on the Moodle site: GIFT format . You can use the GIFT Question Editor to validate or generate your own GIFT formatted quiz questions. Create a quiz Try to create a quiz that has at least 3 different questions of different types for one of the learning units of your Open Science course. Validate your quiz using the GIFT Question Editor . Assessment Strategy Once you have defined your quiz questions, the next step is to define the quiz strategy. This strategy can be defined separately for each quiz as a common strategy for all formative quizzes, or can be one strategy for the summative final exam In the first case, a separate strategy document needs to be developed for each learning unit, while for the later two options (recommended) the quiz strategy can be described in the main facilitation guide document (see next learning unit for more details). If each learning unit has its own quiz strategy then it should be provided together with the learning unit. The assessment strategy needs to describe the following items: how many questions should be used from the questions pool is there any weight that should be given to the questions questions order (random or specific) answers order quiz duration when the quiz starts and finishes how many times it can be taken grading method completion rules results publication guide To summarise, a complete learning unit consists of several parts: learning unit plan learning unit content optional slide deck or similar type of instructional material activities description assessment quiz and strategy Note that in the next stage, Prepare, you will train on how to create the content from scratch. At this point in the Design stage the goal is only to introduce you to the type of information that needs to be provided in each of the defined documents. The Instructor Kit The main goal of the instructor kit is to support the trainers and instructors in the delivery of the learning materials. It is also essential for high quality reusability of the learning materials by other trainers and/or instructional designers. The complete instructor kit consists of learning materials that are developed and used to support the learning process, but are not directly visible by learners. These include the following items: learning unit plan activity details quiz question banks quiz strategies facilitation guide feedback questions Most of the items were already introduced and discussed in 06 - Learning Unit Development . Here we will only focus on the last documents: the facilitation guide and the feedback questions. Facilitation Guide As the syllabus represents the learner's view of the learning materials, the facilitation guide is a document that represents the trainers view and aims to enable a smooth and efficient training. Thus the guide aims to help with the general activities regarding the organisation of the training, what needs to be done before, during and after the training, how to setup the training environment, prepare any props and materials, etc. A well-defined facilitation guide should include the following elements: what to do before during after the training where are all of the materials that should be used during the training digital materials location physical resources and equipment needed e.g. projector e.g. activity resources such as card decks etc. how to prepare the materials beforehand e.g. something needs to be written on flip charts how to prepare the learning environment room layout and any other specifics (e.g. name tags, sign-in sheet, etc.) in case of an online training this includes preparation of the virtual room, providing access, sending out or publishing reading materials, etc. In the case of a summative or common quiz strategy it can contain this information as well. For best visibility, the guide should also contain shortcuts to all activities planned. However, any specific details and notes should be available in the learning unit plan. Feedback questions At the end of the learning process you should gather feedback from the learners so that they can provide feedback on what worked well and what should be improved in the training and learning materials. For these purposes a set of feedback questions should be drafted. The feedback can be gathered by enabling the learners to answer the questions using different modalities: physically by filling out a feedback sheet digitally using a feedback form created on the learning platform or using some other survey system An example Training Evaluation form is presented in the next subsection. A similar evaluation form can be created using the feedback tool in the Skills4EOSC platform. Do not forget to set the following settings of the defined feedback used for training evaluation: availability from - to anonymous no multiple submissions show analysis page (for transparent review of the results) Training Evaluation Form In Skills4EOSC we strive to provide high quality training and continuous improve our training activities.

This document incorporates all aspects that should lead to a high quality learning experience as it defines the plan on how to use teaching methods and the learning content together with activities to achieve the defined learning objectives. Note that an effective lesson plan for online trainees may not be the same to the one for traditional workshop settings. Formally, a unit plan refers to a detailed step-by-step guide for a trainer to understand what materials to give to students and how to provide them so students would accomplish their learning goals. There may be different detail levels of the learning unit plan: Detailed: a detailed plan that includes what will be the trainer step-by-step plan and learning activities. Semi-detailed: a semi-detailed plan is less complex and offers a general game plan of what will be covered in the unit. It is recommended that you follow the Hunter's model for developing a learning unit plan: Set the learning objectives These are lower level learning objectives for the particular learning unit. Combining all learning objectives from all units should lead to the high level learning objectives defined in the syllabus. Ensure these are clear and follow a logical order that is easy to understand and help identify meaningful concepts and ideas. Follow the Bloom's taxonomy again. Identify the needs of the target audience Make sure you are prepared to help learners along the way Plan your training material Create a list of all the resources. From stationary like a pen or paper to technology equipment like laptops, software, or gamified learning tools like apps or any website, all these can help you get the most out of what you intend to do. Present the outline of the unit - the Hook Throughout the training, the goal is to keep learners engaged. An outline can help them develop a context around the subject, letting them know what is coming next, and encourage them to relate to the learning materials at hand. Don\u2019t forget to draw relevant examples of events or develop creative activities that spark interest and attention. Instruct the lesson Follow the order and present the resources you need, but also make sure to involve the learners in this process. You may use as much multimedia as you want to facilitate engagement and give a wealth of examples learners can relate to easily \u2013 most important is to present the information in a meaningful way. Provide time to practice Once you finish your instruction, it\u2019s the learners\u2019 turn to take the lead. Ask them to show what they have learned through practice. For an example start with a guided practice \u2013 allowing learners to make sense of the information they have just received. Then you can follow up with a collaborative process \u2013 let them work in groups to explore main concepts. Finish with independent practice \u2013 giving each time to work on their own through an assignment. Wrap-up Do an overview of what has been discussed and what has been learned. Ask learners to tell you the key takeaways, identifying main ideas and conclusions. Give a preview of the next unit to prepare them. Evaluate Determine whether the learning objectives have been met, and ensure that learners understood what you taught through a small quiz, test, or exam.

Remember to design the content so that it appeals learners with different modalities (verbal, audio, read/write, kinesthetic) including different multimedia. The learners notebook is the main learning content that you are aiming to introduce the learners to. The content of each learning unit notebook should include: brief introduction learning objectives target audience duration prerequisites learning tools content summary suggested reading Again, although some items may seem repetitive compared to the syllabus, bear in mind that this is done in order to improve reusability. In this way the learning unit can be reused as a stand alone package. Remember to add different types of media to the content, supporting an integrated multi-modal approach. For pure self-based learning the complete notebook should be enough to present all of the learning content in one place. However, for trainer led environments, usually a slide deck is also necessary so that the trainer can lead the trainees across the learning content and work with them through the activities. The slide deck should follow the stages of the HUNTER model : title slide introduction (trainers and trainees) Housekeeping information Learning Objectives Training Outline Training Topic information example guided activity Wrap up key takeaways final Q&A assessment information feedback gathering","title":"Learning Content"},{"location":"1st%20Session/05%20Facilitator%20kit/Facilitator%20kit/#activity-details","text":"All activities that are planned to be performed with or by the learners as part of the learning unit plan should be described in enough details so that they can be executed by any trainer or facilitator no matter if they are part of the original instructional design team or not. They could be only tasked with training implementation, or they could be simply reusing the learning material. In addition, this additional documentation related to activity description can serve as a personal reminder long after the training has been completed and it allows for keeping notes on how the activity was implemented as well as any external community feedback. Based on the best practices, each activity should be described in a separate document that contains: activity name short description duration number of people it can be performed with goal materials instructions tips and tricks related sources comments This example of an activity description document related to one of the activities offered in this training can help you visualise the type of information that needs to be included for each activity.

Traditionally, there are many different types of assessments that can be performed, but the most typically used in professional training and certification is the quiz form. In general, quizzes can be used in a large variety of settings, providing opportunities for reflection, knowledge improvement with feedback or assessment. Although they can be setup as formative (after each learning unit) or summative (one exam quiz at the end), from the FAIR-by-design perspective, it is recommended that at least the questions that form the quiz are setup in a formative way, meaning each learning unit comes with a set of questions that are related to that particular learning unit. In this way, it is up to the instructor to setup the assessment: is it going to be multiple quizzes throughout or is it going to be one in the end. When designing the quiz questions one should go back to the Bloom's taxonomy introduced . This time however, you are interested in what type of quiz question can be used to assess the knowledge of a different level of the cognitive domain. This is presented in the table below. T/F MC MS LA SA FIB MAT ORD Create X Evaluate X X X X Analyze X X X Apply X X X X X Understand X X X X Remember X X X X X where T/F - True/False MC - multiple choice MS - multi-select LA - long answer SA - short answer FIB - fill in the blank MAT - Matching ORD - Ordering The easiest way to define the quiz questions in a reusable format is to use the GIFT quiz format that can then be imported in the Skills4EOSC learning platform (the other way around is also possible, export the questions created on the platform in GIFT for others to reuse). The provided Quiz GIFT Template contains examples of the different types of questions. Detailed instructions on how to write quiz questions in the GIFT format can be found on the Moodle site: GIFT format .

This strategy can be defined separately for each quiz as a common strategy for all formative quizzes, or can be one strategy for the summative final exam In the first case, a separate strategy document needs to be developed for each learning unit, while for the later two options (recommended) the quiz strategy can be described in the main facilitation guide document (see next learning unit for more details). If each learning unit has its own quiz strategy then it should be provided together with the learning unit. The assessment strategy needs to describe the following items: how many questions should be used from the questions pool is there any weight that should be given to the questions questions order (random or specific) answers order quiz duration when the quiz starts and finishes how many times it can be taken grading method completion rules results publication guide To summarise, a complete learning unit consists of several parts: learning unit plan learning unit content optional slide deck or similar type of instructional material activities description assessment quiz and strategy Note that in the next stage, Prepare, you will train on how to create the content from scratch.

To achieve this, not only the learning objectives, but all content, activities, assignments and assessments must be learner-centered. Learners perform best when they are engaged in authentic activities, collaborate with peers to share and deepen their understanding, and apply their existing skills to different contexts and new problems. Rich learning experiences can be supported by inquiry-based learning structures, such as projects and performance tasks thoughtfully interwoven direct instruction opportunities to practice and apply learning It is important that learners are given meaningful tasks that build on their prior knowledge together with a safe positive environment in which they can receive timely and helpful feedback. Units should be well structured so as to reduce the unnecessary cognitive load, and based on multiple modalities and tools for accessing information and expressing learning to support different types of learners. Learning modalities refer to the different ways individuals process and retain information. These modalities highlight the diverse preferences and strengths people have when it comes to learning. The most commonly recognized learning modalities include: Visual Learners who prefer visual modalities understand and remember information better when it is presented in a visual format, such as diagrams, charts, graphs, and images. They benefit from seeing concepts and ideas. Auditory Auditory learners process information most effectively when it is heard. They learn well through lectures, discussions, podcasts, and verbal instructions. Reading/Writing These learners prefer interacting with text-based information. They excel in reading and writing tasks, such as taking notes, reading books, and writing essays or reports. Kinesthetic Kinesthetic learners are hands-on learners who grasp concepts best through physical activity and movement. They benefit from experiments, role-playing, and using objects or tools. Some theories and frameworks expand on learning modalities, recognizing that people often use a combination of these modalities rather than relying on a single one. Understanding and catering to different learning modalities can enhance teaching strategies and improve learning outcomes by providing varied methods of instruction that align with learners\u2019 preferences. Adding multimedia to the learning content Incorporating multimedia into learning content is directly related to learning modalities because it allows educators to address and engage different types of learners more effectively. Multimedia aligns with various learning modalities: Visual Learners: Multimedia can include videos, infographics, animations, and diagrams that visually represent concepts. This appeals to visual learners by providing clear and engaging ways to understand and remember information. Auditory Learners: By adding audio elements such as narrations, podcasts, or sound effects, multimedia caters to auditory learners who benefit from hearing information. This can include explanations, discussions, or even background music that reinforces the learning material. Reading/Writing Learners: Multimedia can integrate text-based elements, such as subtitles, captions, or interactive reading materials, which appeal to learners who prefer to read and write. Hyperlinks to additional reading, digital flashcards, or interactive eBooks also support this modality. Kinesthetic Learners: Interactive multimedia, such as simulations, virtual labs, or drag-and-drop activities, allows kinesthetic learners to engage with the content through physical interaction. This hands-on approach helps them better grasp and retain the material. By integrating multimedia, educators can create a richer, more inclusive learning environment that accommodates different learning preferences. It also helps to reinforce concepts through multiple channels, increasing the likelihood that learners will understand and retain the material. Adding multimedia to MD content While Markdown itself is quite simple, it can be enhanced with multimedia by incorporating various elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content. Different types of multimedia can be added to Markdown content by: Images To add images, use the following syntax: ![Alt text](image-url) such as ![A beautiful sunset](https://example.com/sunset.jpg) or if it is a local file ![Alt text](./path/to/image.jpg) Images in MD One of the most important things to remember is that the \"alt text\" is alternative text for the image that is used for accessibility purposes. It will be read by a screen reader that helps learners with visual impairments. Icons add visual interest and can help convey meaning quickly. While Markdown itself doesn\u2019t support icons natively, you can use HTML or rely on Markdown extensions or themes that support icons. Example <i class=\"fas fa-info-circle\"></i> This is an informational icon. Videos While Markdown doesn\u2019t natively support embedding videos, you can use HTML to embed videos from platforms like YouTube or use a link to direct users to the video.

This helps keep the repo lean as video files are quite big, plus it allows you to use some advanced features such as auto captioning, chapters, playlists, etc. GIFs Another option is to use embedded GIFs as short videos.

Accessible multimedia Provide transcripts and captions for audio and video content to make them accessible to all users. Interactive elements For more complex interactive elements, one might use HTML or specialized tools that support enhanced Markdown (like Jupyter notebooks or MkDocs): Interactive Maps, Charts, or Widgets: You can embed these by using <iframe> or specific Markdown extensions supported by your platform. Example (Embedded Map using HTML) <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18...\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe> Slideshows If you need to add a slideshow, you might use Markdown libraries such as Reveal.js that convert Markdown into presentation slides. Linking to Files For documents, PDFs, or other files: [Download the PDF](https://example.com/document.pdf) Markdown Extensions Some Markdown processors support extended syntax for including multimedia, such as MathJax for equations or Mermaid for diagrams. See the example in the previous module where the structure is presented using Mermaid. Admonitions are special call-out boxes that highlight important information or warnings. They help users quickly identify key points or notes. Use Admonitions to Highlight Key Information. Code blocks can also be used to provide source code examples to learners. Integrating Jupyter Notebooks with MkDocs can provide a powerful way to combine interactive code, data analysis, and documentation. This is particularly useful for projects that involve both technical explanations and live code examples. To mix MD with Jupyter Notebooks you can: Convert Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown or HTML Jupyter Notebooks can be converted to Markdown or HTML, which can then be included in your MkDocs site. Use nbviewer or GitHub Gists for Live Notebooks services like nbviewer or GitHub Gists to embed live notebooks, such as [View Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/username/repository/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) Use jupyter-book for a Comprehensive Solution consider using jupyter-book, which is designed to work with Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown to create interactive books. also, the jupyter-mkdocs plugin enables you to run Jupyter Notebooks directly within MkDocs. Final Tips Maintain a Consistent Style : Use consistent image sizes, captions, and positioning throughout your content. Test Compatibility : Ensure that the multimedia elements work in the Markdown processor or platform you\u2019re using. Responsive Design : Ensure that your multimedia content is responsive, especially when using HTML, so that it looks good on different screen sizes. Provide Download Links for Media : Some users might prefer or need to download media files instead of viewing them directly in the browser. Documentation : Ensure that you provide clear documentation and context for users interacting with the Jupyter notebooks. DON'T Don\u2019t Overload Pages with Too Much Multimedia Why: Excessive multimedia can overwhelm users, slow down page loading, and distract from the core content. Tip: Use multimedia sparingly and only when it adds value to the content. Don\u2019t Use Low-Quality Media Why: Poor-quality images, videos, or audio can reduce the credibility and professionalism of your content. Tip: Always use high-resolution images and clear audio/video files. Don\u2019t Forget to Test Media Content Why: Media might not display or function as expected across different browsers or devices. Tip: Always test embedded media on multiple platforms before publishing. Don\u2019t Ignore Accessibility Why: Multimedia content should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Tip: Use alt text, provide transcripts for videos, and ensure that interactive elements are keyboard-navigable. Don\u2019t Link to Unreliable External Sources Why: Linking to external media that may be removed or blocked can result in broken links or missing content. Tip: Host essential media content yourself or ensure that external links are stable. Don\u2019t Use Auto-Playing Media Why: Auto-playing videos or audio can be intrusive and may disrupt the user\u2019s experience. Tip: Always allow users to control when media plays. Don\u2019t Neglect to Credit Sources Why: Failing to attribute media to its original creator can lead to copyright issues and diminish the trustworthiness of your content. Tip: Always include proper citations or credits when using third-party media. Don\u2019t Rely Solely on Multimedia Why: Some users may prefer or require text-based content, so always include a textual explanation or description of your multimedia. Tip: Pair videos with summaries, and images with descriptive captions. This approach helps create rich, multimedia-enhanced learning content that can cater to different learning modalities, making your materials more engaging and effective. Accessibility All developed learning content should be accessible to a wide range of learners with different needs from a variety of backgrounds, abilities and learning styles. To ensure this the developed content needs to be checked so that access is optimised and all unnecessary barriers are removed making it inclusive and easier to engage with by all learners including people with disabilities. Accessible educational materials (AEM) are defined as educational materials that are designed or later enhanced in such a way that it makes them usable across the widest range of learner variability. For digital learning materials and technologies this means that they are accessible if they can be easily used by anyone, including people with disabilities. Accessible digital learning materials need to be designed so that they can be directly used without assistive technology or made usable with assistive technology. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for accessible materials: simple text structure helps learners with a variety of learning needs, including learners for whom the language used is not their native language simple navigation through the materials should help access the content from mobile devices, as well as learners with low vision adding captions to videos helps learners with hearing impairment as well as learners that have low prior knowledge on the subject and key terminology. General guidelines for development of accessible materials Most of the techniques used for development of accessible learning materials are based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) that focuses on the design of learning materials that are aimed to be inclusive of as many learners as possible. This approach, combined with the assistive and accessible technologies, can ensure that every learner has access to the same materials. UDL is based on three fundamental principles: Multiple means of representation learning content should be presented in different ways and formats Multiple means of action and expression several options for action and expression should support the demonstration of acquired knowledge Multiple means of engagement learners differ in what engages and motivates them so multiple options should be provided The following are some general tips and guidelines that should help develop accessible learning content: Present the information in multiple ways and formats This helps support various learning styles and provides alternatives for different impairments. Use simple language The materials should be accessible for the learners' varying levels of access, background, and ability. An option is to provide additional resources to support learners that have comprehension difficulties. Use headings Assistive technologies differentiate the structural elements in the text (body text and different levels of headings). These help screen readers process the text correctly. Use table of content Helps learners navigate to the required information easily. Provide alternative text for images The alternative text is read by the screen reader instead of the image. Decorative images should be marked as decorative so that the screen reader can skip them. Use equation editors for math expressions This format helps screen readers understand the content. Use a high contrast color palette High contrast supports learners with vision impairments. Don't use color as the only way to convey information Provide other alternative means for color blind learners. Use descriptive links Links to other documents should explain where the link is taking the learner. Use tables only when required If a table is truly the best way to convey the information and not just a layout trick, then use column and row headers to describe the content. Provide closed captions and transcripts Helps make the information in the video accessible to the vision impaired. Alternative text tips and tricks For tip on how to write alternative text for images study the Alternative text guide by WebAIM . The key takeaways in the guide include: alternative text should be accurate and equivalent in representing content and function alternative text should be succinct alternative text should not be redundant alternative text should not include phrases such as \"image of ...\" or \"graphic of ...\" Decorative images should have blank alternative text. A decorative image is an image that does not present important content is used for layout or non-informative purposes does not have a function (e.g. is not a link) !!! tip \"Use accessibility evaluation tools!\" --- Accessibility evaluation tools are not perfect. Even if they say that all is ok, it does not mean that your content is truly accessible. But they are a very good starting point. === \"Slides\" Use the integrated accessibility checker in Power Point: 1. Open an existing presentation in PowerPoint and review the content. 2.

Summary To create an engaging and inclusive learning experience, it\u2019s essential to understand and integrate various learning modalities, incorporate multimedia effectively, and ensure accessibility. Learning modalities include visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and read/write styles, each catering to different ways individuals process information. By incorporating multimedia elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content, educators can address diverse learning preferences and enrich the educational experience. This not only helps in accommodating various learning styles but also makes the content more engaging and dynamic. Ensuring accessibility is crucial in making learning resources usable for all individuals, including those with disabilities. This involves using descriptive alt text for images, providing transcripts and captions for audio and video content, and ensuring high color contrast and responsive design. Additionally, interactive elements should be navigable via keyboard, and semantic HTML should be employed to aid screen readers in interpreting content. By following these best practices, educational content becomes more inclusive, allowing all learners to access and benefit from the material effectively.

To achieve this, not only the learning objectives, but all content, activities, assignments and assessments must be learner-centered. Learners perform best when they are engaged in authentic activities, collaborate with peers to share and deepen their understanding, and apply their existing skills to different contexts and new problems. Rich learning experiences can be supported by inquiry-based learning structures, such as projects and performance tasks thoughtfully interwoven direct instruction opportunities to practice and apply learning It is important that learners are given meaningful tasks that build on their prior knowledge together with a safe positive environment in which they can receive timely and helpful feedback. Units should be well structured so as to reduce the unnecessary cognitive load, and based on multiple modalities and tools for accessing information and expressing learning to support different types of learners. Learning modalities refer to the different ways individuals process and retain information. These modalities highlight the diverse preferences and strengths people have when it comes to learning. The most commonly recognized learning modalities include: Visual Learners who prefer visual modalities understand and remember information better when it is presented in a visual format, such as diagrams, charts, graphs, and images. They benefit from seeing concepts and ideas. Auditory Auditory learners process information most effectively when it is heard. They learn well through lectures, discussions, podcasts, and verbal instructions. Reading/Writing These learners prefer interacting with text-based information. They excel in reading and writing tasks, such as taking notes, reading books, and writing essays or reports. Kinesthetic Kinesthetic learners are hands-on learners who grasp concepts best through physical activity and movement. They benefit from experiments, role-playing, and using objects or tools. Some theories and frameworks expand on learning modalities, recognizing that people often use a combination of these modalities rather than relying on a single one. Understanding and catering to different learning modalities can enhance teaching strategies and improve learning outcomes by providing varied methods of instruction that align with learners\u2019 preferences.","title":"Learning modalities"},{"location":"1st%20Session/06%20Rich%20learning%20exp/Rich%20learning%20experience/#adding-multimedia-to-the-learning-content","text":"Incorporating multimedia into learning content is directly related to learning modalities because it allows educators to address and engage different types of learners more effectively. Multimedia aligns with various learning modalities: Visual Learners: Multimedia can include videos, infographics, animations, and diagrams that visually represent concepts. This appeals to visual learners by providing clear and engaging ways to understand and remember information. Auditory Learners: By adding audio elements such as narrations, podcasts, or sound effects, multimedia caters to auditory learners who benefit from hearing information. This can include explanations, discussions, or even background music that reinforces the learning material. Reading/Writing Learners: Multimedia can integrate text-based elements, such as subtitles, captions, or interactive reading materials, which appeal to learners who prefer to read and write. Hyperlinks to additional reading, digital flashcards, or interactive eBooks also support this modality. Kinesthetic Learners: Interactive multimedia, such as simulations, virtual labs, or drag-and-drop activities, allows kinesthetic learners to engage with the content through physical interaction. This hands-on approach helps them better grasp and retain the material. By integrating multimedia, educators can create a richer, more inclusive learning environment that accommodates different learning preferences. It also helps to reinforce concepts through multiple channels, increasing the likelihood that learners will understand and retain the material.","title":"Adding multimedia to the learning content"},{"location":"1st%20Session/06%20Rich%20learning%20exp/Rich%20learning%20experience/#adding-multimedia-to-md-content","text":"While Markdown itself is quite simple, it can be enhanced with multimedia by incorporating various elements such as images, videos, audio, and interactive content.

Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protects the interests of the creators and owners by providing them with rights over their creation. For the purposes of creation of learning materials, the copyright and related rights main branches of IPR are used. They are defined to protect literary and artistic creations, performances, phonograms by defining the authors\u2019, owners\u2019, performers\u2019, producers\u2019 and broadcasters\u2019 rights. In some cases additional IPR branches might be involved. Copyright Original work can be protected by copyright law that grants the owner exclusive right to control certain rights such as reproduction. The copyright is owned jointly by all authors, or it may be owned by the employing institution. Any work that you create by default makes you or your institution/employer the copyright holder of it. Use of copyright protected work requires permission from the owner . Permission may not be required in the case of works licensed in the public domain and uses covered by Copyright Exceptions. Only the copyright holder is allowed to distribute whatever is created. If you want to transfer this right to other people as well, you can do that via a license. In absence of exceptions or limitations, one can reuse an existing work if it is licensed to the user or it is licensed to the public using a public license such as the Creative Commons (CC) licenses or Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) licenses . Licensing The content in this section contains material taken from: CC FAQ website licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license Creative Commons license Wikipage (2023, June 21) in Wikipedia licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0 A license allows you to define rights and obligations regarding the use of your work. One of the best sources of information for licensing reusable learning materials is Creative Commons . There are many available CC License options which are based on the four baseline rights. It is recommended that the least restrictive CC BY 4.0 license , requiring only that credit is given to the creator when reusing, is used when creating new learning materials. The ND right falls into the opposite extreme and is not recommended for FAIR learning materials licensing as it severely limits their reusability in adaptations. Public domain licensing (CC0) is also not recommended as different rules apply in different countries. The CC License Chooser tool helps authors share their work in a standardised way providing copyright licenses that enable sharing and reuse of the creative work under the chosen conditions. To apply a license all you have to do is indicate which CC license you are applying to your work. You should then check the terms of the chosen license and comply with the requirements therein. For an example, it is strongly recommended to include a link to the relevant CC license deed (e.g., https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). Example is provided below: Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Commons Attribution 4.0 International License Respect the licenses, to be respected!\u200b Materials with non-permissable licenses can be used for inspiration only. Materials with permissable licenses should be reused based on the license rules. Attribution and Citing The right to attribution is a moral right of the authors that protects the personal relationship between the author and the created work even if the creator does not own the copyright. For work created by others that you are incorporating into your own work you want to make it easy for others to know who created what parts of the work. In other words, acknowledgement of the reused materials through attribution is always needed (even if it is not a requirement of the license, such as the public domain licenses). One condition that is required for all CC licenses is attribution. The ideal attribution follows the TASL approach: T itle - what is the name of the work A uthor - who allows you to use the work (name and link) S ource - where can the work be found (link added to title) L icense - how can the work be used (name and link to the license) If your work is a modification or adaptation of another work, indicate this and provide attribution to the creator of the original work. You should also include a link to the work you modified and indicate what license applies to that work. Citing A citation allows authors to provide the source of any quotations, ideas, and information that they include in their own work based on the copyrighted works of other authors. However, in the case of using direct quotations with citing, it is essential that the amount of information referenced is very limited.

Defining How to cite Citation files are plain text files with human- and machine-readable citation information that tells others how to cite or attribute your work. There is a an open source project that defines the Citation File Format (CFF) in a CITATION.cff file so that there is a structured, uniform way of decribing how others should cite your work. CITATION.cff is written in a YAML format and has controlled vocabularies for most of the supported fields. The purpose of this file is to provide information on how the materials (Git repository) should be cited. Its content, among other things, also controls the text shown when the Cite this repository button is clicked on the right hand side of a GitHub repository's homepage. Create your own citation file The citation file is a specific file wherein you need to provide the correct information so that it can be correctly processed.

Copyright automatically applies to original works, requiring permission for reuse unless the work is in the public domain or covered by specific exceptions. Licensing, especially through Creative Commons (CC), provides a way for creators to define how others can use their work. Attribution and citation are crucial for recognizing and respecting the original creators. All CC licenses mandate attribution, which can be effectively managed using the TASL approach\u2014Title, Author, Source, and License. Proper citation ensures legal compliance and honors the intellectual contributions of others. The use of CITATION.cff files is also encouraged, as they provide a standardized format for describing how a work should be cited, which is particularly useful in open-source projects and for maintaining consistent citation practices across platforms.

One of the best sources of information for licensing reusable learning materials is Creative Commons . There are many available CC License options which are based on the four baseline rights. It is recommended that the least restrictive CC BY 4.0 license , requiring only that credit is given to the creator when reusing, is used when creating new learning materials. The ND right falls into the opposite extreme and is not recommended for FAIR learning materials licensing as it severely limits their reusability in adaptations. Public domain licensing (CC0) is also not recommended as different rules apply in different countries. The CC License Chooser tool helps authors share their work in a standardised way providing copyright licenses that enable sharing and reuse of the creative work under the chosen conditions. To apply a license all you have to do is indicate which CC license you are applying to your work. You should then check the terms of the chosen license and comply with the requirements therein. For an example, it is strongly recommended to include a link to the relevant CC license deed (e.g., https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). Example is provided below: Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Commons Attribution 4.0 International License Respect the licenses, to be respected!\u200b Materials with non-permissable licenses can be used for inspiration only.

In other words, acknowledgement of the reused materials through attribution is always needed (even if it is not a requirement of the license, such as the public domain licenses). One condition that is required for all CC licenses is attribution. The ideal attribution follows the TASL approach: T itle - what is the name of the work A uthor - who allows you to use the work (name and link) S ource - where can the work be found (link added to title) L icense - how can the work be used (name and link to the license) If your work is a modification or adaptation of another work, indicate this and provide attribution to the creator of the original work.

It is available for all popular platforms either as a first-party command line utility or through third-party graphical user interface (GUI) clients. Git uses the concept of repositories which can granularly manage the versions of all objects placed within it. File changes are committed to a repository and each commit is automatically associated a unique and random identifier. In addition to this identifier, each commit is also described by its author, commit title and commit description. A single Git repository can be used by multiple users, each contributing and committing their changes. To facilitate remote collaboration, a Git repository can be shared publicly or privately. Git hosting services, such as GitHub and GitLab offer this functionality today for free. While Git can also be used independently from such hosting services, either completely locally and offline or by devising a custom synchronization workflow with third parties, in reality this is rarely the case. Git repositories can also be forked , meaning that their current state is copied to a brand new repository, preserving all history. The user who has initiated the fork can then make any desired changes directly to their own fork of the repository. If desired, such changes can optionally be reconciled and added to the original repository from which the fork was created, provided that they are accepted by the original owner. This is possible due to the fact that the repositories will have a shared history at least up until the point when the fork was made. In case their files have diverged (e.g., both the original and forked repository contain changes to the same files), and if these changes are conflicting (e.g., changes to the same part of a given document), Git will mark these changes and leave it up to the owner of the repository to decide how to proceed, and what version to accept. Below is a list of common Git related terminology which will be useful for the remaining of the training: Git repository \u2013 a collaborative space where files can be versioned Git commit \u2013 a granular change of a single or multiple files in the repository, identified by a random unique identifier, the committer's name, email address, short commit title and an optional longer commit description. A commit can contain file additions, modifications, removal, or relocation to a different directory. Git clone \u2013 an action to download locally an existing Git repository. A repository hosted on a public Git hosting service such as GitHub can be cloned by anyone (assuming it is public) on their local machines. Once downloaded, users can explore the repository and optionally send their contributed changes upstream, if they have been assigned the necessary permissions. Git fork \u2013 a 1:1 copy of an existing Git repository. A fork of an existing repository results with the creation of a brand new repository which will have a shared history with the original one up until the fork was made. The owner of the forked repository will be the user who initiated the fork. The original owner of the repository does not have any right in the forked repository by default. Pull request/Merge request \u2013 when changes are made to a forked repository, they can be contributed back to the original repository by creating a merge request or a pull request (the terms are synonyms, depending on the platform either one can be used). With this approach a privileged user from the original repository from which the fork was initiated can review the changes and decide whether to accept them, modify them, or outright reject them. Forks can exist independently of the original repository forever. Filling out RELEASE_NOTES.md Open the RELEASE_NOTES.md` file by clicking on its name from the left-hand directory tree. The file uses a special Markdown syntax which allows its contents to be shown as collapsed on the syllabus home page, thus preserving space. For the initial release, alter the text below the 1.0.0 heading and make sure to also update the date of the release in the heading itself. For all subsequent releases, add a new level two heading using two hash symbols on a new line, ( ## ) just below <summary>Release Notes <summary> . Ideally, the RELEASE_NOTES.md file should list the various versions in a descending order, sorted by the release date. New iteration The work on a new iteration starts once the list of identified improvements that will be incorporated into the new version is finalised. The next step is to organise the work regarding the required changes to the learning materials. Depending on the identified improvements, the changes may bring you back to the Produce stage implementing changes in learning units, or even to Design if restructuring of the learning material is needed. When all planned changes are implemented following the requirements and recommendations of the ( Design and) Produce stage(s), you can then move again through the Publish stage and create a new release with a new version number that will then be added as a new version on Zenodo. Note that the provided automated workflow will not create a new independent record on Zenodo, but will add a new version to the already existing Zenodo record . For the specific steps of the publication process please refer back to the respective lesson unit in the Publish stage. The version number is one of the things that you will need to provide when activating a new release. The recommendation based on best practices is to keep the versioning in the Major.Minor.Patch version number sequence. You will increment the minor number if the incremental improvement does not change the overall structure of the learning materials. You will increment the major number if the changes include change in the overall structure of the learning materials. Increment the Patch number in case of only technical fixes.

Don't forget to update the resource on the Learning Platform. This is a requirement if the learning material is provided as a self-paced course for an example, but might not be needed if it was a one-time training workshop event after which it is not expected that the learners will keep coming back to the learning content. Note that if you are using the /latest links when adding the resources to the learning platform, you don't need to update any of the external links on the learning platform.

Luckily, validators are also widely available, and we will discuss some options in this space in the Activity, below. README.md is a Markdown file which should briefly describe the repository, so that first time visitors can get an initial idea what it is about. The README.md file's content is shown immediately below the directory browser on the repository's homepage. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md , as its name suggests, describes the contributors' code of conduct which needs to be adhered to. It defines standards for how to engage in a community. It can also contain steps for resoling issues between members of the community. GitHub also shows a direct link to a repository's code of conduct (if available) above the citation information. RELEASE_NOTES.md is a special Markdown file that keeps provides description of all the changes made to the material since its first release. The content of this file is embedded as is on the Git book homepage (the syllabus) in a collapsible block. In the activity that follows we will go over all of the required changes that need to be made to these files, along with tips, and any potential pit-falls when it comes to controlled vocabulary fields. Activity: Publishing Preparation in Practice - Customizing Accompanying Files Setting up the Environment Make sure that the latest changes have been pulled from the remote using the GitHub Desktop application Open the Obsidian workspace Ensure that all three files are already available (as a result of forking the templates repository previously) in the root of the repository: CITATION.cff , README.md , CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md . Filling out CITATION.cff Click on CITATION.cff in Obsidian's file tree pane. In some environments Obsidian might not be able to automatically open the file since it has an unsupported extension - .cff . If so, select a preferred text editor which is already installed on your system (e.g., Notepad on Microsoft Windows). Fill out the appropriate information in the following fields: authors - a list of authors who participated in the creation of the learning materials title - title of the training abstract - a short abstract describing the learning materials license (if a license other than the default CC-BY should be used) license-url (if a license other than the default CC-BY should be used) keywords - list of keywords which describe the learning materials repository - the URL to the GitHub repository where the materials are hosted While filling out the file and adding new lines, make sure that they match the indentation of the examples. The picture below provides a visual example of how to correctly add a new author. The newly added author (an imaginary John Doe) should have the same indentation (number of spaces at the beginning of the line) as the first author which is given as an example in the template. Inconsistent number of spaces will make the CITATION.cff file invalid. Additionally, we denote that we are adding information about a new author by prefixing the first property (in this case family-names ) with a - character. Note that any other fields also present in the CITATION.cff file such as: version , doi , date-released should not be manually edited . They will be updated automatically when publishing the repository to Zenodo. After having done the necessary updates to the fields, you can validate the structure of the CITATION.cff file using the free online utility which is available on citation-file-format.github.io . Paste the content into the text field Press the PARSE button Ignore any warnings about \"extra\" fields. It is important that a message stating Parsed CFF successfully appears. In case there is a validation error, a descriptive error message will be shown, pointing to the line that is incorrectly formatted. Assuming that the correct indentation policy is not followed when specifying the first name of an author, the error message will be: Save the changes made to the CITATION.cff file and close the text editor. Filling out README.md Go back to Obsidian and open the README.md file by clicking on its name from the left-hand directory tree. The content of the README.md file is free text, so you are welcome to provide any introduction that you would like. Just make sure to keep the official Skills4EOSC header image, and a reference to the templates repository. Filling out CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file, as present in the templates repository is a generic text that can be applied to any future trainings. Go over the text and make any desired changes. Make sure to alter the contact information for the person responsible for the enforcement of the code of conduct rules, specified in the Enforcement section. Customizing the Signposting Information The automated workflows provide an easy way of implementing Signposting for the developed content. Minimal changes are needed to the mkdocs.yml to configure the automated workflow for Signposting. The mkdocs.yml file acquired from the templates repository has 3 dedicated parameters related to the implementation of Signposting: signposting_linkset - should never be changed manually; its content is handled by the workflow itself. signposting_default_profile - in case the source markdown files for the learning content follow a standardized and registered format, they can be further described by providing a link to the upstream profile. This is an optional field that can be left blank, in which case no profile information will be provided. More information is available on the Signposting docs page . signposting_gitbook_url - an optional parameter that is commented by default. It should be uncommented only in cases when a custom domain is configured for hosting the Git book, instead of the default provided by GitHub. Uncommenting can be performed by removing the leading # character. signposting_exclusions - a list of file names that should not be referenced in the generated Signposting linkset description. Accompanying material such as activities, lesson plans, and feedback templates are already excluded by default. Pattern matching is supported. A single * matches any character in files at the current folder level, while ** applies to all subfolders as well, irrespective of their position in the directory hierarchy. In most cases, such as when Signposting Level 1 is sufficient, no manual changes need to be performed. If the content follows a well-defined template, then signposting_default_profile needs to be updated so that it points to the URL containing the template's description. As a result of running the Signposting workflow a linkset.json file is placed in the root of the repository. Committing Changes Once the three files have been updated, commit the changes and push them to GitHub using the GitHub Desktop application. Upon every change of the CITATION.cff file an automated action is executed which verifies its contents. In case of a validation error, you will receive an email message similar to the one shown below. The recommended action in such cases is to simply retry the validation of the CITATION.cff file manually using the citation-file-format.github.io tool. Make sure to address any errors, committing and pushing the results to GitHub once completed.

There is always room for improvement and many times need and requirement to keep up to date with the development and changes in the field of subject of the learning materials. Therefore a regular analysis of all QA aspects is necessary to identify potential elements for improvement. Based on the outcomes of the feedback analysis, the authors of the learning materials should make a plan for the development of a new version of the learning materials. Feedback analysis As discussed in the previous learning unit, there are multiple sources that can serve for feedback gathering and QA: feedback form external QA recommendations self-reflection after training GitHub issues gathered comments from external contributors direct mail contact any other means of communication (e.g. feedback from workshops, discussions, team meetings, etc.) The input from all of these sources should be gathered and analysed. The results of the analysis should be a list of potential improvements, each marked with an impact level (high, moderate, low). The next step is to decide which of the improvements will be addressed in the next version and how will this be achieved. Note that depending on the number of identified improvements, you might need to go through the improvement cycle multiple times. It is recommended that the changes are done in an incremental fashion and that changes done in one version are logically related. This help both developers and users to better understand the differences between the versions.
